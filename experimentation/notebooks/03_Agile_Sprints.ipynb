    "The Agile approach transforms the agent from an open-loop system to a closed-loop control system with:\n",
    "- **Sprint-based execution**: Time-boxed research iterations\n",
    "- **Retrospective reflection**: Course correction after each sprint\n",
    "- **Backlog management**: Dynamic re-prioritization of research questions\n",

      "Large language models (LLMs) can deliver substantial, measurable benefits in enterprise settings — particularly for repeatable, high-volume tasks such as content/document workflows, customer operations, software engineering, and certain R&D activities — but they also introduce material security, privacy, reliability, and operational risks that can erode or reverse net value unless actively managed. Empirical and vendor/analyst reports show productivity and time-to-market gains often in the tens of percent, but real-world outcomes vary and depend on use-case scoping, measurement discipline, and controls. Key unresolved gaps include systematic quantification of security incident likelihood/impact, total cost of ownership (TCO) under realistic workloads, and production failure rates for hallucinations and remediation effort [https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier; https://www.worklytics.co/resources/calculating-roi-generative-ai-tools-worklytics-framework; https://www.paradisosolutions.com/blog/measure-ai-productivity-gains-metrics/].\n",

      "1) Key benefits (evidence-based)\n",
      "- Large, repeatable time savings and productivity gains. Multiple industry reports and case studies show sizeable speed-ups for narrowly scoped tasks:\n",
      "  - Content & document workflows: reported reductions in content-creation time and faster document processing in vendor/industry accounts (typical headline improvements repeatedly cited are tens of percent) [https://www.paradisosolutions.com/blog/measure-ai-productivity-gains-metrics/].\n",
      "  - Software engineering: developer-assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot and similar tools) have been associated with productivity gains commonly reported in the ~30–55% range, with broad adoption among engineers [https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/github-copilot-statistics/; https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier].\n",
      "  - Economic concentration: McKinsey estimates roughly 75% of generative-AI economic potential is concentrated in customer operations, marketing & sales, software engineering, and R&D — indicating where enterprises should prioritize pilots for near-term value [https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier].\n",
      "\n",
      "- Faster time-to-market and scaling of content-driven programs. For use cases with high volume and repeatability (tickets, summaries, templated copy, first drafts), LLMs reduce time-per-transaction and enable greater throughput at similar headcount, producing measurable campaign or service capacity lift when integrated with measurement frameworks [https://www.worklytics.co/resources/calculating-roi-generative-ai-tools-worklytics-framework; https://www.kumohq.co/blog/ai-roi-measurement-framework].\n",
