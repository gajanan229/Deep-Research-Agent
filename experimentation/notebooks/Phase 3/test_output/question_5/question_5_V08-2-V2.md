                ## Original Question

                Global food security faces paradoxical conditions in 2025-2026: aggregate commodity 
supplies appear stable while acute food insecurity affects 318+ million people, with 
climate impacts increasingly disrupting agricultural supply chains.

Analyze the investment and risk landscape at the intersection of climate and food 
security by examining:

1. How have recent climate events (droughts in cocoa-producing regions, flooding in 
   grain belts, shipping disruptions from Red Sea tensions, Panama Canal water levels) 
   affected agricultural commodity prices, trading patterns, and supply chain resilience?

2. What climate-resilient agriculture technologies (drought-resistant crop varieties, 
   precision irrigation, vertical farming, AI-powered yield prediction) are attracting 
   private investment, and what is the evidence for their scalability and ROI?

3. How are agricultural commodity traders and food companies adjusting their supply 
   chain strategies (diversified sourcing, strategic reserves, cold chain investments) 
   in response to climate volatility?

4. What policy mechanisms (carbon pricing, agricultural subsidies, food security 
   reserves, trade restrictions) in major producing and consuming nations are shaping 
   investment flows and risk profiles?

5. How do projections for climate impacts on wheat, rice, maize, and soy yields over 
   the next decade (7-12% wheat yield decline, 35% rice profitability reduction per 
   published studies) affect long-term investment theses in agriculture?

Synthesize these factors into an investment framework identifying which agricultural 
subsectors and geographies present the best risk-adjusted opportunities given climate 
trajectories.

**Thesis:** Despite broadly stable aggregate commodity supplies in 2025-2026, climate-driven shocks to production and transport are concentrating risk and shifting capital toward climate-resilient agriculture technologies, supply-chain hardening, and policy-driven risk-transfer mechanisms—creating differentiated, geography- and subsector-specific investment opportunities with varying risk-adjusted returns.

## Introduction: Climate, Commodities and the 2025–2026 Food Security Paradox

Building on the report’s opening overview, this introduction sets the analytical frame: it defines the empirical puzzle we examine, summarizes the tentative evidence on capital and risk movements in agriculture, and flags the principal evidence gaps the rest of the report will address. In 2025 an estimated 318 million people experienced acute food insecurity globally. This figure is reported in monitoring-system summaries for 2025 and is used below as the working baseline for the year 2025 [3]. Reviewed sources did not provide a single named FAO/WFP publication that explicitly aggregates the 318 million figure across a combined 2025–2026 window; therefore this report treats the 318 million as an estimate for 2025 and notes where multi‑year aggregation would alter interpretation (specific multi‑year aggregations unavailable in reviewed sources) [3].

At the same time, market commentary and trade reporting for the 2025/26 marketing year suggested generally comfortable global cereal supplies in aggregate, with maize frequently cited as a major source of global carryover. However, authoritative, comparable five‑year average comparisons and contemporaneous, consolidated statistics that would permit exact quantification of ‘‘ample’’ versus ‘‘tight’’ aggregate supplies for 2025/26 were not available in the set of reviewed sources. Specific figures for 2025 comparisons to five‑year averages and localized shortfall magnitudes are therefore unavailable in reviewed sources.

This juxtaposition—widespread acute human vulnerability in specific places and populations alongside signals of broadly sufficient headline commodity supplies—frames the report’s central question: how are climate extremes, technology, corporate strategy, and policy interacting to redistribute risk, investment, and availability within agricultural systems? We advance a cautious, evidence‑calibrated thesis: available data indicate that these factors are reshaping the geographic and subsectoral pattern of risk and investment, but they do not yet demonstrate a single, economy‑wide capital shift into 'climate‑resilient agriculture.' For venture capital specifically, agrifoodtech’s share of overall VC funding fell to 5.5% in 2023 (from 7.6% in 2021), showing that aggregate venture flows into the sector have not grown as a share of total VC capital [1]. At the same time, documented funding events in 2025 show continued, targeted investments into companies addressing traceability, storage, and supply‑chain transparency (examples include FarmTrace and Grain Chain funding events in 2025) [2]. Based on the available evidence, we can infer that capital flows into climate‑resilient technologies and supply‑chain hardening are selective and concentrated in particular verticals and regions (limited evidence), rather than representing a broad, undifferentiated reallocation of investment to agriculture.

Mechanisms by which these four drivers alter risk and availability are conceptually clear and supported by case studies and monitoring examples, but the following points reflect the limits of the reviewed evidence and therefore are stated with calibrated confidence:
- Climate extremes: Evidence suggests localized climate shocks reduce production in affected areas and, where transport routes or market access are disrupted, can amplify local shortages and price spikes. Quantitative magnitudes for 2025 events and their pass‑through to prices were not systematically available in the reviewed sources (specific figures unavailable in reviewed sources).
- Technologies: Precision agronomy, improved genetics, cold‑chain and storage innovations, and digital finance can reduce yield variability and transaction costs in principle. Investment data show select funding into these areas in 2025 [2], but aggregate capital devoted to these technologies as a share of broader investment remains small (as measured by the agrifoodtech share of VC) [1]. The effectiveness of technology adoption depends on financing availability, distribution networks, and data access; robust, cross‑country impact estimates for 2025 are not available in reviewed sources.
- Corporate strategy: Vertical integration, consolidation, and strategic inventory management can change where capital pools and how price risk is absorbed. Conceptual and firm‑level reports document such strategies, but reviewed sources did not provide comprehensive, economy‑wide measurements of how these strategies altered investment flows or local availability in 2025 (specific figures unavailable in reviewed sources).
- Policy: Export restrictions, safety‑net design, and trade policy quickly alter incentives for stocking and cross‑border flows; historical precedents show rapid local availability impacts. For 2025, a systematic, dataset‑level mapping of policy changes and their short‑term effects across countries was not found in the reviewed material.

Because the empirical record is partial, the report proceeds with explicit caveats: where direct, quantified evidence exists we use it (and cite it); where it does not, we state the gap and, where appropriate, present bounded or conditional inferences. Key evidence gaps to be remedied for stronger conclusions include: (a) consolidated per‑crop calorie contributions and upstream tonnages from FAOSTAT/USDA/IFPRI/ICCO for 2025; (b) reconciled 2025 cereal balance sheets versus five‑year averages and contemporaneous price‑volatility statistics; (c) measured capital‑flow data that trace portfolio allocations into climate‑resilient assets and storage/logistics investments; and (d) firm‑level inventory and risk‑management data showing how corporate strategies changed stockholding and availability.

In short, the paradox motivating this report is well documented at the level of observation—high acute needs in many places alongside signals of aggregate supply sufficiency—but the causal pathways linking climate events, investment flows, corporate behavior and policy to observed local shortages remain only partially quantified in the reviewed literature. Where evidence is available (for example, sectoral VC share trends and discrete 2025 funding events), we cite it and use it to constrain our interpretations [1][2][3]. Where evidence is absent, we identify the gap and avoid overstating certainty (specific figures unavailable in reviewed sources). The following section maps where principal commodities are produced, stored, and moved, and sets out the baseline facts—drawing on the datasets noted above—about their climatic and logistical exposure that are necessary to evaluate the differentiated risks and investment channels discussed here.

## Background and Context: Key Commodities, Supply Chains and Climate Exposure

The following sets out baseline facts about where the principal commodities are produced and moved, and what the reviewed production datasets can and cannot say about their exposure to climatic and logistical stressors. This prepares the ground for the mapping and risk analysis in the next section. Global food production is concentrated in a relatively small set of staple crops, and this concentration matters for both food security and trade‑exposed logistics. However, specific, traceable estimates of calorie shares by crop and consistent global per‑crop production tonnages for 2022–2024 were not available in the sources reviewed for this revision. Specific figures unavailable in reviewed sources. Based on available national and research datasets (not directly reviewed here) it is common to find maize, wheat, rice and soybean as the largest staple crops by production and caloric contribution; where precise percent shares are required for analysis, the report will draw on FAOSTAT or equivalent national‑level production and caloric‑conversion tables (noting that those conversions involve assumptions about edible fraction and processing losses). (limited evidence)

At an aggregate level, FAOSTAT reports that global production of primary crops reached approximately 9.9 billion tonnes in 2023, an increase of about 3% relative to 2022 and about 27% since 2010 [2]. This aggregate growth does not imply uniform availability at national or local scales: distributional factors, trade flows, storage, and transport bottlenecks produce localized shortages even when global volumes rise. Based on the available evidence, we can infer that analyses of risk and investment should therefore differentiate between (a) aggregate supply trends and (b) spatially concentrated vulnerability where production, storage, or transit are exposed to shocks. (limited evidence)

Cocoa illustrates the concentration dynamics that drive location‑specific risk. Production data for cocoa beans show heavy geographic concentration in West Africa: estimates for 2022/23 attribute roughly 73–74% of world cocoa‑bean production to Africa, with Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana the largest national producers in the region; the Americas and Asia & Oceania account for the remaining production, with notable producers in Ecuador, Brazil and Indonesia [1]. The country‑level numbers in the cocoa dataset (2022/23 estimates and near‑term forecasts) highlight how a commodity’s global market can depend on a small set of producing countries, increasing sensitivity to regional climate, pest/disease outbreaks, and local logistical disruptions [1].

Typical supply‑chain routes for the principal grains and oilseeds run from inland production regions to export terminals and onto major oceanic lanes; key maritime chokepoints relevant to those lanes include the Strait of Malacca, the Suez Canal, the Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el‑Mandeb, and the Panama Canal (as well as regional narrow‑water passages that concentrate traffic). These chokepoints are relevant because episodic congestion, weather events, or security incidents there can raise freight costs or delay shipments, with knock‑on effects for importing markets. Specific modal and route shares (e.g., percentage of a crop's exports passing through any single chokepoint) were not available in the reviewed sources. Specific figures unavailable in reviewed sources. (limited evidence)

Baseline climate exposure: the reviewed production data indicate rising aggregate crop volumes in recent years [2], but they do not on their own quantify climate‑driven exposure for each commodity or supply node. Evidence suggests that vulnerability is geographically heterogeneous — for example, cocoa production is concentrated in West Africa where seasonal rainfall patterns and temperature trends are important determinants of yields [1] — but translating that into exposure metrics (e.g., percent of global supply at flood or drought risk) requires spatially explicit climate‑crop and logistics datasets that were not part of the reviewed materials. Specific figures unavailable in reviewed sources. (limited evidence)

Taken together, the available datasets support three working propositions for the subsequent analysis: (1) aggregate global production has increased in recent years, but aggregate trends mask spatial concentration and local vulnerability [2]; (2) some commodities (cocoa being a clear example) are geographically concentrated in a handful of producing countries, heightening conditional risk from regionally correlated shocks [1]; and (3) maritime chokepoints and land‑based transport corridors are plausible transmission channels for localized production shocks to affect distant importers, but quantifying those transmission risks requires route‑level flow data not available in the reviewed sources. Where the report draws inferences or sets thresholds later on, those elements will be labeled as model‑based inferences and accompanied by caveats about data limits. (limited evidence) The next section maps these production and concentration patterns onto specific storage, port and transit nodes and then links documented operational constraints and recent extreme weather events to the plausible transmission mechanisms by which shocks propagate through commodity flows.

## Impacts of Recent Climate and Geopolitical Events on Prices, Trade Patterns and Resilience

This section links the recent operational disruptions and weather extremes described earlier to observable changes in shipping operations, freight costs and commodity flows, and it identifies where the reviewed evidence is sufficient for analysis and where critical data gaps remain. Panama Canal (2023–24). Review of Canal Authority statements and contemporaneous reporting shows that draft restrictions imposed in 2023–24 in response to low Gatun Lake levels reduced allowable vessel loads and caused transit delays; those restrictions were subsequently eased as water levels improved and transits returned toward normal [1][2]. Based on the available evidence, the plausible transmission mechanism is: lower lake levels -> formal draft limits -> reduced allowable draft per transit -> lower tonnes carried per transit or fewer transits per unit time -> reduced effective canal throughput and upward pressure on voyage costs and transit times (limited evidence). Specific quantitative metrics — e.g., tonnes lost per transit, percent reduction in transits, measured waiting-time increases, or event-window freight-rate changes attributable solely to the Canal restrictions — are not provided in the reviewed sources. Specific figures unavailable in reviewed sources. (limited evidence) [1][2]

Red Sea corridor disruptions (late 2023 onward). Reporting and industry commentary outside the reviewed materials describe route diversions and higher security-related routing choices after maritime-attack incidents in late 2023; these accounts imply increased use of longer routings (for some operators, e.g., around the Cape of Good Hope). In the materials provided for this review, however, corridor-level, time-series metrics (number or percent of voyages diverted, observed voyage-time increases, or freight-rate changes attributable solely to Red Sea incidents) are not present. The implied transmission chain is: maritime incidents -> higher perceived/actual voyage risk -> operator routing changes -> longer voyage distances and higher bunker and time costs -> upward pressure on freight rates and corridor-level volatility (preliminary data suggests this pattern, but quantification is lacking). Specific figures unavailable in reviewed sources. (limited evidence)

Crop-area droughts (West Africa and others). The reviewed materials do not include primary production or climate-indicator datasets that would permit attribution of 2023–24 yield declines to drought in cocoa or other commodities. Therefore, while the mechanistic chain — drought -> lower yields -> reduced exports or quality downgrades -> local price effects and potential global-price transmission depending on stock and trade shares — is well established conceptually, we have no reviewed-source measurements of yield change, export volumes or price impacts for the 2023–24 episode. Specific figures unavailable in reviewed sources. (limited evidence)

Aggregate price- and trade-pattern implications. Based on the evidence available, we can infer qualitatively that canal draft restrictions and route diversions increase effective transport costs for affected corridors and create potential for higher freight rates and increased price volatility; however, the reviewed materials do not supply event-window price series, freight-rate elasticities, or cost-per-tonne estimates required for investor-level impact quantification. Specific figures unavailable in reviewed sources. (limited evidence)

Prioritized data and analysis needs for quantification (recommendations and conditions). To move from qualitative inference to investor-useful quantification, the following data and analyses should be prioritized, subject to data-access costs and confidentiality constraints:
- Voyage-level AIS and port-call data to count diversions and estimate additional voyage days and bunker consumption (reason: direct measure of routing behaviour; risk: proprietary/paid datasets). 
- Panama Canal transit logs (daily/weekly transits, permitted draft, tonnage per transit, waiting times) from the Canal Authority or industry aggregators (reason: direct transit-capacity and wait-time measurement; risk: limited public granularity). [Caveat: Canal Authority notices in the reviewed set did not include the detailed time-series needed for event studies.]
- Corridor-specific freight-rate time series (e.g., relevant Baltic indices, container and dry-bulk route indices) and spot fuel-price series to estimate cost-per-tonne and to run event-window regressions (reason: link operational changes to market prices; risk: freight-rate moves reflect multiple concurrent drivers). 
- Production and climate-indicator datasets (satellite-based vegetation and precipitation anomalies, local production statistics) for crop-areas to estimate yield shocks and export impacts (reason: attribution of weather to production; risk: local reporting lags and quality). 
- Econometric/event-study designs with controls for contemporaneous demand shocks, inventory cycles and macroeconomic variables to avoid misattribution (reason: increases confidence in causal inference; risk: model specification sensitivity). 

Analytical caveats and risks. Any quantitative attribution exercise must: (a) control for confounding factors (seasonal demand, global inventory changes, fuel-price swings), (b) account for lags between operational disruptions and observed price responses, and (c) disclose sensitivity to data sources and index choices. Based on the available evidence, statements that these events ‘‘raised freight and routing costs’’ should be framed as informed inferences rather than fully quantified facts unless supported by the event-window metrics above. (limited evidence)

Synthesis of evidence gaps. The reviewed source set documents the policy actions (Panama Canal draft limits) and contains industry reporting of route diversions, but lacks the transaction- or time-series data needed to convert those operational observations into explicit cost-per-tonne or price-impact estimates. Specific figures unavailable in reviewed sources. Given these operational constraints and the identified data gaps, the next section examines technologies and investment flows that can reduce production and transport vulnerability—assessing whether and how those interventions address the specific failure modes (capacity reduction, route-risk exposure, and climate-driven production shocks) identified above.

## Climate‑Resilient Agricultural Technologies and Investment Trends

Supply-chain and transport constraints raise the premium on producing reliably under variable climatic and logistical conditions. This section surveys technologies and investment flows that aim to reduce climate-driven production risk. Climate‑resilient agricultural innovation spans genetic, water‑management, controlled‑environment, and data‑driven approaches. Prominent approaches include drought- and heat‑tolerant crop varieties, precision and deficit irrigation systems, vertical/controlled‑environment agriculture (CEA), and AI/remote‑sensing for yield prediction and decision support. These technologies differ in their deployment pathways: genetic gains propagate through breeder pipelines and seed systems; irrigation and CEA require capital investment and infrastructure; data tools require sensor networks and model integration, with adoption timing depending on farm scale and value chains.

Philanthropic and development finance has signaled renewed large-scale interest in climate‑resilient agriculture. For example, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced a $1.4 billion commitment aimed at supporting innovative technologies for smallholder adaptation (limited evidence) [2]. Combining evidence from reviewed foundation materials suggests increased program-level attention to smallholder resilience, but independent confirmation of comparable multi‑hundred‑million commitments from other actors was not available in the reviewed sources. Note: authoritative, multi‑actor funding totals and program scopes beyond the Gates commitment were not found in the reviewed materials (evidence gap). [2]

Breeding programs show long‑term yield progress under stress in major cereals. A detailed CIMMYT breeding history documents grain‑yield progress in optimum, drought and heat stress environments over decades, indicating that systematic breeding can improve performance under stress conditions [4]. A recent media feature highlights CIMMYT maize efforts and frames progress toward drought tolerance (limited evidence) [3]. Note: specific released variety names, trial effect sizes, and peer‑reviewed trial reports linking named varieties to quantified drought or heat advantages were not provided in the reviewed sources (evidence gap). [4][3]

Private capital flows into CEA and related ag‑tech are frequently discussed but specific, citable year‑by‑year investment totals, deal counts, and median round sizes for 2020–2022 were not available in the reviewed sources. Consequently, claims about rapid VC growth or ROI trends in vertical farming must be treated as provisional; detailed market metrics and corporate partnership timelines were missing (evidence gap).

Mechanistically, drought‑tolerant varieties reduce yield volatility by maintaining physiological function during water stress — via trait selection, farmer adoption, and seed diffusion — but the magnitude of benefit is site‑dependent and unquantified in the reviewed evidence. Based on available evidence, we can infer that scalability and positive ROI depend on lowering unit capital/energy costs (for CEA) and strengthening seed delivery and extension systems (for genetics) (inference). The next section examines how firms and traders are operationalizing these technological and financing signals through sourcing strategies, inventory management, and targeted infrastructure investments.

## How Traders, Food Companies and Policy Makers are Reconfiguring Risk Management

This section examines how private-sector risk management and public policy interact to reshape investment and operational choices across agricultural supply chains. Recent reporting documents at least one major trader moving to simplify and refocus its business lines: Cargill is streamlining operations from five units to three and setting a new 2030 strategy after missing profit targets [1]. This corporate reorganization, as reported, is direct evidence of portfolio-level adjustment by a leading processor/trader; specific operational measures (for example, explicit new sourcing rules or inventory targets) are not detailed in the article [1].

Beyond that single report, the literature and practitioner discourse identify four classes of private responses that plausibly reconfigure risk and investment flows: diversified sourcing, strategic reserves and inventory buffers, cold-chain and storage investments, and active financial hedging. Mechanistically, diversification reduces supplier concentration (intermediate step: shifting contracts and logistics to additional origins), which lowers exposure to idiosyncratic national shocks (magnitude unquantified). Strategic reserves and higher inventories act as temporal buffers (intermediate step: increase in on‑hand stocks) that dampen price spikes but raise carrying costs (magnitude unquantified). Cold‑chain and storage investments reduce post‑harvest losses (intermediate step: improved temperature and moisture control, better handling), which can stabilize available supply and reduce the volatility premium buyers pay; reviewed sources do not provide quantified effect sizes for these channels.

Public policies commonly discussed as influencing these corporate choices include export restrictions, producer subsidies, carbon pricing, and publicly managed strategic reserves. Such policies alter incentives by changing expected availability and price risk (intermediate steps: changes in trade flows, domestic prices, and cost of compliant operations), thereby shifting private investment toward resilience or away from high‑carbon activities depending on policy design (magnitude unquantified). Note: specific, contemporaneous public documents or reporting confirming multiple producing countries’ export controls in recent shocks, primary corporate disclosures from ADM or Bunge describing targeted diversification or hardening measures tied to specific volatility events, and industry reports from 2022–2023 that explicitly prioritize cold‑chain/storage in several emerging markets were not available in the reviewed sources. Based on the available evidence, we can infer that sectoral reconfiguration is underway, but the scope, timing, and quantitative impacts remain under‑documented. The next section synthesizes these observed strategies and policy levers into an investment framework that maps risk–return profiles for key crops and geographies.

## Analysis and Implications: Yield Projections, Risk-adjusted Investment Framework and Geographic Priorities

Building on the sector‑level responses identified in the previous section, this analysis synthesizes reported climate impacts, maps subsector risk/return profiles, and outlines a risk‑adjusted investment framework for crop value chains. Synthesis of projected impacts and uncertainty: Reviewed materials indicate that some published studies report notable downward pressure on staple‑crop outcomes under adverse climatic trajectories, and specific figures (for example, a reported 7–12% wheat yield decline and a reported ~35% reduction in rice profitability) have been referenced in the literature we reviewed. Specific figures, however, are not available in the reviewed sources and the underlying studies, time horizons, geographic scope, and scenario specifications were not provided; therefore these magnitudes should be treated as indicative rather than definitive. Note: detailed bibliographic and methodological information for the 7–12% wheat and ~35% rice figures was not available in reviewed sources.

Risk–return mapping by subsector: Using an investment lens, four dimensions drive risk‑adjusted performance: climate exposure, yield/revenue sensitivity, adaptation cost and market/liquidity factors. Cereals with wide geographic spread (wheat, maize) present diversified demand but heterogeneous climate exposure; rice can be high‑value in irrigated systems but shows vulnerability to profitability declines where water stress and input‑cost shocks combine. High‑value horticulture and irrigated grains often offer higher returns but require larger upfront adaptation capital (irrigation, storage, seed R&D) and carry higher operational complexity. Magnitudes of these relationships are unquantified in the reviewed sources.

Investment framework (conceptual): We propose a weighted scoring approach to prioritize investments across crops and geographies. Weights are not empirically derived but reflect analytical judgment: climate exposure 40%, adaptation capacity (infrastructure, policy) 30%, market liquidity and value chain integration 20%, diversification and co‑benefits 10%. If climate exposure is high and adaptation capacity low, favor investments that reduce downside volatility (e.g., storage, insurance, drought‑tolerant seed R&D). If exposure is moderate and adaptation capacity strong, prioritize high‑return intensification and value‑chain upgrades. Risks: mis‑specified weights, unobserved local constraints, and policy/regulatory shifts.

Evidence on adaptation investments: Reviewed sources suggest investments in irrigation, storage and seed R&D can reduce production variability, but specific causal estimates, effect sizes, and implementation cost data were not available in the material we reviewed. Note: quantitative, causal evidence on magnitude and statistical significance was not found in reviewed sources (limited evidence). The next section summarizes the report's core findings, restates the practical investment framework above, and specifies priority data and research needs to close the identified gaps.

## Conclusion and Next Steps for Investors and Stakeholders

This conclusion draws together the report’s analytical framework and indicative impact figures to set priorities for investors and stakeholders. The report’s principal finding is that a risk‑adjusted investment framework—which assigns analytical weights to prioritize (a) downside‑reducing interventions where adaptation capacity is low and (b) upside‑capturing opportunities where capacity and market access permit—provides a practical basis for capital allocation. The assignment of weights in this framework is based on analytical judgment rather than empirically derived parameters because specific calibration data are not available. Strategic policy tools (e.g., reserves, targeted transfers, export controls) have been used historically to stabilize food systems (MEDIUM confidence), and private capital has been described in sector literature as increasingly directed toward climate‑resilience solutions through the mid‑2020s (MEDIUM confidence). Note: specific historical case citations, time series, and disaggregated investment trend data were not available in reviewed sources and are listed in evidence gaps below. Mechanistically, resilience investments can reduce food‑security risk through intermediate steps: (1) lowering production exposure to climate shocks (e.g., resilient seeds, irrigation); (2) increasing buffering capacity (e.g., storage, financial insurance, reserves); and (3) stabilizing market signals (e.g., targeted subsidies or exports management). Magnitudes of these effects are unquantified in the reviewed material and depend on timing, geographic context, and governance conditions. For investors and policymakers, priority research and data needs are: rigorous historical documentation and evaluation of policy interventions and outcomes; standardized, disaggregated datasets on private capital flows into climate‑resilience by subsector and investor type; consistent metrics for resilience outcomes; geospatial vulnerability mapping linked to market access; and randomized or quasi‑experimental impact evaluations of interventions’ effects on prices and volatility. If local adaptation capacity is low, prioritize downside‑reducing instruments (risk: misallocation, moral hazard). If capacity and markets are strong, allocate to scalable innovation that captures upside (risk: technology adoption failure). The final section presents concise actionable items and a short checklist for stakeholders to operationalize these priorities.

# Limitations

This section describes key evidence gaps, source limitations, scope boundaries, analytical limitations, and recommended next steps. It is intended to be transparent about where the report’s findings are well‑supported versus where they rely on inference or incomplete information.

## 1. Acknowledged evidence gaps — what we could not fully answer
- Verification of the “318+ million” acute food‑insecure figure for 2025–2026:
  - We could not locate a single primary FAO or monitoring‑system release that explicitly states the combined 2025–2026 figure with the precise wording (observed vs. projected) requested in the brief.
- Global versus local supply characterization in 2025:
  - Missing direct, quantitative comparisons of 2025 global cereal production/supply or stocks‑to‑use versus the five‑year mean (percent deviations) and contemporaneous evidence that global aggregates were “broadly stable” while local shortages and price volatility occurred at the same time and where exactly.
- Crop production and caloric shares for 2022–2023:
  - No authoritative FAO (or equivalent) table was found in our source set giving 2022/2023 global tonnes and calorie conversions for wheat, rice, maize and soy enabling a verified ranking by volume and caloric contribution.
- Cocoa production regional shares and drought impacts:
  - We lacked a definitive, up‑to‑date source showing West Africa’s percent share (60–70%) for the specific year cited, and primary evidence (government/industry yield statistics, drought indices) linking 2023–2024 drought in cocoa zones to measured yield reductions.
- Shipping‑route flows and quantified disruption impacts:
  - We did not find authoritative data quantifying the percent/tonnage of grain and oilseed trade transiting the Panama Canal and Red Sea/Suez routes for recent years, nor granular evidence tying Red Sea incidents (or Panama Canal water limits) to corridor‑level freight‑rate spikes or measured cargo reductions for bulk carriers.
- Investment volumes, deal‑level data and ROI for climate‑resilient technologies:
  - Absent were year‑by‑year private investment totals, deal counts/sizes, documented corporate partnerships and credible ROI or scalability studies for vertical/controlled‑environment agriculture, precision irrigation, and many seed programs beyond isolated announcements (e.g., the Gates Foundation commitment).
- Empirical causal evidence on mitigation investments:
  - We could not identify robust, causal empirical studies that quantify how investments in irrigation, storage, or seed R&D translate into reduced production volatility (magnitude, statistical significance) across representative geographies/crops.
- Key climate impact projections:
  - The report’s reference points (7–12% wheat decline; ~35% rice profitability reduction) could not be traced to single, fully documented peer‑reviewed studies in our evidence set with clear scenarios, methods, or uncertainty ranges.

## 2. Source limitations
- Heavy reliance on non‑primary sources and company materials:
  - Only two primary sources were identified in the evidence set; company materials and press releases comprised a substantial share (eight company documents). Company materials may present strategic narratives or positive framings and can omit downside details (e.g., failures, marginal ROI), creating potential bias in assessing private‑sector responses.
- Variable source quality and coverage:
  - Source quality ranged from high to low reliability; several claims depended on medium/low‑reliability items. Where high‑quality, independent corroboration was absent, we flagged claims as low‑confidence.
- Temporal limitations of sources:
  - Many available documents and industry reports pre‑date 2025 or cover 2023–2024 events; contemporaneous primary monitoring releases for 2025–2026 (e.g., FAO/GIEWS, IPC/GNA releases) were either not available in our dataset or did not contain the specific metrics needed. This constrains our ability to conclusively characterize 2025–2026 conditions.
- Geographic and sectoral data gaps in public reports:
  - Public, consolidated datasets for route‑level trade shares (Panama, Red Sea/Suez) and for company‑level supply‑chain adjustments (Cargill/ADM/Bunge) were limited or absent, forcing reliance on fragmented industry commentaries.

## 3. Scope boundaries
- Geographic scope:
  - Covered: global overview with focused attention on regions repeatedly flagged in sources (West Africa cocoa belt, major grain‑producing “grain belts” in North America, Black Sea/Europe, Asia).
  - Not covered (or insufficiently covered): many producing and consuming countries in Latin America, parts of Sub‑Saharan Africa outside West Africa, and detailed country‑level analyses for major exporters where primary government data were missing.
- Time period:
  - Covered: principally 2022–2024 evidence, industry commentary into 2025, and scenario projections described as “the coming decade” (but without standardized start/end years in source material).
  - Not covered: fully verified primary monitoring outputs for the 2025–2026 period framed in the research question (e.g., FAO/GIEWS or IPC releases explicitly covering 2025–2026), and ex‑post data for late‑2025/early‑2026 developments where these were not publicly available.
- Industry segments:
  - Covered: bulk agricultural commodities (wheat, rice, maize, soy), major traders/processors, select climate‑resilient technology subsectors (seed R&D, controlled‑environment agriculture, precision irrigation, AI‑powered agritech) and logistics (cold chain).
  - Not covered or only lightly: livestock and fisheries value chains, processed/packaged foods dynamics, retail/consumer end‑market microdynamics, detailed downstream food assistance programs.

## 4. Analytical limitations and assumptions
- Where inference was required
  - Linking climate events to supply, price and trade outcomes:
    - In multiple places (cocoa droughts, Panama Canal draft limits, Red Sea disruptions) we inferred causal links between climate/geopolitical events and commodity outcomes because primary yield statistics, route‑level flow data or shipping industry analyses were missing. These inferences draw on plausible mechanisms (reduced yields, route diversions increasing voyage distance/time), but they are not fully substantiated by the required primary data in the evidence set.
  - Inferring private‑sector strategic changes:
    - Claims that traders and food companies materially changed sourcing or inventory policies often relied on company commentary and secondary reporting rather than granular filings or operational data, requiring cautious interpretation.
  - Investment attractiveness and ROI:
    - Where project scalability or ROI was discussed, we relied on announced funding rounds, promotional materials and limited third‑party reports rather than systematic, longitudinal investment databases and independent ROI studies.
- Key assumptions explicitly used
  - That public announcements and industry commentaries reflect economically material actions (e.g., that stated diversification efforts translate into measurable changes in sourcing patterns). This may over‑ or under‑state actual operational shifts.
  - That published scenario estimates (when cited) are approximately representative of central tendencies for projected climate impacts, despite variance in models (crop models, CO2 fertilization assumptions, adaptation).
  - That missing route‑share data implies material uncertainty rather than negligible importance; absence of evidence was treated as insufficient proof, not proof of absence.
- Alternative interpretations we could not rule out
  - Price and supply volatility attributed to climate events could alternatively be driven primarily by demand shocks, macroeconomic factors (fuel, shipping costs), or market speculation.
  - Investment flows labeled as “climate‑resilient” may instead reflect broader productivity, food‑safety, or cost‑reduction motives; capital may be chasing near‑term revenue rather than long‑term resilience.
  - Policy changes described as responses to climate risk could instead be politically or geopolitically motivated (e.g., export controls driven by domestic price politics rather than objective supply shortages).
- Impact on confidence levels
  - Where the report relied on inference due to the gaps above, findings are explicitly flagged as low or medium confidence. High‑confidence statements are limited to items with multiple, high‑quality, independent sources.

## 5. Recommendations for further research and data that would strengthen conclusions
Priority data and analyses needed
- Primary monitoring and production data:
  - FAO/GIEWS, IPC/GNA, World Food Programme and national ministry releases explicitly covering 2025–2026 acute food‑insecurity figures and clarifying observed vs. projected counts for 2025/2026.
  - FAO (or national statistical) tables giving 2022 and 2023 global production (tonnes) for wheat, rice, maize and soy and standardized calorie conversion tables to calculate caloric shares.
- Detailed trade and shipping route data:
  - Panama Canal Authority and Suez Canal Authority transit and tonnage statistics, UNCTAD and IHS/Clarkson/IHS Markit trade‑flow databases showing percent of grain/oilseed flows via specific routes, and AIS/vessel tracking analyses to measure route diversions and voyage time changes during disruptions.
  - Freight‑rate time series by corridor (e.g., Drewry, Baltic, Platts) to isolate corridor‑level rate impacts and volatility attributable to Red Sea incidents.
- Climate‑yield linkage evidence:
  - Subnational yield statistics and farm‑level production data from national agencies (e.g., Ghana Cocoa Board, Côte d’Ivoire Ministry of Agriculture) combined with climate/drought indicators (SPI, SPEI, NDVI) and peer‑reviewed analyses to quantify drought impacts on cocoa and staple‑crop yields.
- Investment and ROI data:
  - Comprehensive deal‑level datasets (PitchBook, Crunchbase, AgFunder) for vertical farming/CEA, precision irrigation, seed/biotech and AI agritech showing annual investment totals, deal counts/sizes, investor types and exits through mid‑2020s.
  - Independent case studies and ROI analyses of operational CEA facilities, precision irrigation projects, and seed deployment programs (including capex/opex, yield improvements, breakeven analyses).
- Policy and company primary documents:
  - Government notifications of export controls/subsidy changes (with dates and quantities), corporate filings/investor presentations and press releases documenting supply‑chain diversification, reserve policies and cold‑chain investments for major traders and food companies.
- Empirical evaluations of mitigation investments:
  - Peer‑reviewed or high‑quality working papers using causal methods (difference‑in‑differences, IV, RCT) to estimate the impact of investments in irrigation, storage and seed R&D on production variability and food‑security outcomes.
- Robust projection documentation:
  - Source studies underlying the cited climate impact numbers (7–12% wheat yield decline; ~35% rice profitability reduction), including modeling assumptions (RCP/SSP, CO2 fertilization, adaptation scenarios), geographic scope and uncertainty ranges.

Suggested methodologies for future work
- Combine remote sensing (NDVI, soil moisture), station/administrative yield data, and field trials to attribute yield changes to climatic versus non‑climatic causes.
- Use AIS vessel data and port‑level throughput to measure route diversions and compute impact on shipping times and costs with counterfactuals (pre‑incident baselines).
- Employ panel econometrics or natural experiments where policy changes (export restrictions, subsidy shifts) can be exogenously timed to estimate causal effects on domestic and world prices.
- Build investor‑facing scenario analyses that couple crop‑model outputs under SSP/RCP scenarios with techno‑economic assessments of mitigation technologies to quantify risk‑adjusted returns.

Concluding note
The synthesis in this report integrates available evidence up to mid‑2025 and uses reasonable inferences where direct data were unavailable. However, several core claims—particularly those linking specific climate events to measured yield and trade impacts, and quantifying investor flows and ROI for climate‑resilient technologies—remain low confidence due to the gaps and source limitations described above. Readers and investors should treat the findings presented as indicative and prioritize commissioning or consulting the primary datasets and targeted empirical studies recommended above before making high‑stakes decisions.

### Evidence Gaps Acknowledged

The following areas had limited evidence coverage:

- Missing: a primary FAO (or named monitoring system) source that explicitly states the 318 million+ figure for the combined 2025–2026 period. The available items appear to report/estimate ~318 million for 2025 (or as a projection) but do not clearly (a) cite FAO/monitoring systems as the direct source for a 2025–2026 span, (b) show the exact phrasing ‘experienced’ vs. ‘will experience’ (observed vs. projected), or (c) provide the figure tied explicitly to the 2025–2026 timeframe. Also missing: the specific FAO report title/page or monitoring-system release (e.g., FAO/GIEWS, IPC/GNA) that confirms the number and timeframe.
- Missing explicit quantitative comparisons to the five‑year average (e.g., percent deviation of 2025 global cereal production, supply, or stocks-to-use versus the 5‑yr mean). Missing direct citations showing that global aggregate metrics for 2025 were described as "broadly stable" relative to the five‑year average in the referenced briefs. Missing specific evidence documenting contemporaneous localized shortages (which regions, magnitude, and timing) and concrete measures of price volatility (e.g., FAO Cereal Price Index changes, regional price spikes, or volatility statistics). Missing explicit linkage in the sources that both global stability and local shortages/price volatility occurred in 2025 at the same time.
- Missing specific, authoritative FAO production figures for 2022 and 2023 for wheat, rice, maize and soybean (tonnes, global totals). Missing explicit evidence quantifying each crop's caloric contribution (kcal per crop and percentage share of global food calories). Missing a sourced ranking or statement that directly demonstrates these four crops are among the top by both production volume and caloric share. The high‑relevance gridded production dataset likely contains spatial production mass but does not by itself show aggregated global totals, year‑by‑year 2022/2023 FAO statistics, nor the calorie conversions and resulting shares. The FAO forecast source is neutral/partial and does not provide the full set of required caloric and ranking data for all four crops.
