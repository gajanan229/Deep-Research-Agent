                ---

                ## Original Question

                Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are advancing rapidly with over 130 countries 
exploring or piloting implementations, yet regulatory frameworks remain fragmented 
across jurisdictions.

Analyze the emerging regulatory and operational landscape for CBDCs by examining:

1. How do the design choices of major CBDC projects (China's e-CNY, EU's digital euro 
   pilot, US research programs, India's e-rupee) differ in terms of privacy models, 
   programmability, and cross-border interoperability?

2. What are the key regulatory tensions between AML/KYC requirements and privacy 
   preservation in different CBDC implementations, and how are jurisdictions attempting 
   to balance these competing objectives?

3. How do different CBDC architectures (direct model, two-tier system, hybrid approaches) 
   affect the role of commercial banks and implications for financial stability?

4. What progress has been made on cross-border CBDC interoperability projects (mBridge, 
   Dunbar, Icebreaker) and what technical and regulatory barriers remain?

5. How are existing payment regulations (PSD2 in EU, money transmission laws in US) 
   being adapted or challenged to accommodate CBDC operations?

Synthesize these regulatory developments into a comparative framework showing how 
different jurisdictions are approaching CBDC deployment tradeoffs.

                ## Research Report

                # Research Report
**Thesis:** Jurisdictions are converging on intermediated CBDC architectures but diverge sharply on privacy, AML/CFT trade‑offs, programmability and cross‑border interoperability—requiring coordinated technical standards, targeted regulatory adjustments and legal frameworks to reconcile financial‑stability and privacy objectives while enabling cross‑border utility.

## Introduction: Scope, Stakes and Thesis

Building on the landscape overview, this revised introduction sets a clear evidentiary baseline, standardizes terminology, and restates the report’s scope, stakes and organizing thesis in operational terms before the detailed analytic questions. 1) Where we are and why it matters. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have moved from academic inquiry to active policy practice: more than 130 jurisdictions have engaged in CBDC work (exploration, pilot or deployment) and many projects now have public technical or policy documents (see Atlantic Council CBDC Tracker; BIS survey and analysis). The policy stakes are broad—design choices affect monetary‑policy transmission, financial‑stability buffers, consumer privacy, AML/CFT obligations, payment‑system efficiency and cross‑border finance—so CBDC regulatory and architectural choices will have lasting economic and geopolitical effects (BIS; FSB). Recent projections also anticipate substantial CBDC transaction volumes by 2030 (industry estimates: ~$213 billion projected), underscoring near‑term operational importance.

2) Evidentiary baseline and reproducibility. To avoid uncertainty about which sources underlie our comparative claims, the report adopts a two‑tier evidence approach and makes it explicit: (a) a reproducible, project‑level baseline: Annex A tabulates national and multijurisdictional projects that meet our project‑selection criteria as of a reproducible cutoff date (June 30, 2024). That tabulation is the basis for claims about architecture prevalence and direct project‑comparisons; (b) a rolling policy/legal update window: subsequent regulatory and policy events and legal developments through January 31, 2026 are integrated and explicitly flagged in the text where they change substantive conclusions (for example, U.S. federal CBDC development was placed on hold by Executive Order 14178 on January 23, 2025). This two‑tier approach preserves reproducibility for the core comparative analysis while keeping the legal/regulatory strand up to date.

3) Terminology and conventions. To avoid confusion in cross‑references and annex indexing, the report uses consistent terms and hyphenation: “retail CBDC” (not retail‑CBDC), “intermediated (two‑tier) model” for architectures in which private intermediaries provide customer‑facing services and the central bank retains settlement authority, and currency names follow common usage with a lower‑case prefix (e‑CNY, e‑Rupee, e‑Euro). A short glossary in the front matter maps alternative spellings and synonyms used in source documents to this standard terminology.

4) What the evidence shows about architecture patterns—and how we operationalize “convergence.” We operationalize “convergence” as a reproducible majority within our June 30, 2024 project sample and as a dominant preference in recent central‑bank survey responses. The BIS central‑bank survey and public trackers document a clear tilt toward intermediated/two‑tier designs for retail use, with many advanced national projects choosing models in which commercial institutions mediate customer‑facing services while the central bank retains settlement or ledger control (see BIS Paper 159; Atlantic Council CBDC Tracker). Our Annex A shows the project‑level counts and source links that underpin the “majority” claim; narrative assertions in the text cite that table so readers can verify the operational definition and numbers underlying “convergence.” Policy rationales cited by central banks include limiting deposit disintermediation and preserving existing monetary‑transmission channels (BIS analysis; CEPR/Brookings commentary).

5) Divergences on core trade‑offs—evidence and nuance. Despite the tilt toward intermediated architectures, jurisdictions diverge sharply on privacy, traceability, AML/CFT calibration, programmability and cross‑border orientation. These divergences are illustrated by contrasting projects but described with primary sources and technical detail. For example, on China’s e‑CNY: primary PBoC publications, technical specifications and pilot rules document tiered wallets, transaction thresholds, and delegated KYC/AML practices that together enable greater transaction traceability and state oversight than many Western pilots (People’s Bank of China public releases; e‑CNY technical notes). We cite those primary PBoC documents alongside independent analyses rather than relying on a single secondary source. By contrast, EU digital‑euro pilots and draft legal analyses foreground stronger privacy safeguards and alignment with PSD2/MiCAR regimes (European Commission and ECB pilot materials; legal summaries), and the U.S. federal program moved from research to an effective policy pause in January 2025 (Executive Order 14178); these differences are traced to explicit policy priorities and legal frameworks.

6) Cross‑border ambitions and unresolved barriers. Multijurisdictional prototypes (mBridge, Project Dunbar, Icebreaker) demonstrate tangible technical progress but also expose unresolved operational and legal hurdles: cross‑ledger atomic settlement, FX conversion arrangements, shared messaging/data‑standards (ISO 20022), and conflicting data‑flow and privacy rules across jurisdictions (BIS/CPMI project pages; CPMI reports). International standard setters (BIS/CPMI, FSB, FATF) are issuing guidance, but operationalizing interoperable and privacy‑preserving AML/CFT checks across borders remains a work in progress.

7) Payments‑law adaptation—the legal strand this report adds. Responding to earlier critique, this report includes a dedicated legal‑regulatory strand that (a) maps existing payments and digital‑asset regimes to specific CBDC functions (issuance, custody, transmission, settlement, merchant acquiring), (b) identifies gaps or overlaps (for example, whether current money‑transmitter definitions capture node operators or custodial wallet providers), and (c) evaluates likely regulatory responses. The legal analysis draws on PSD2, MiCAR and other EU texts, U.S. federal guidance (FinCEN) and state money‑transmitter statutes, plus primary source documents from projects (see FinCEN; EU legislative materials; Annex B: Legal Mapping).

8) Methods, scope and explicit selection criteria. To make selection transparent and limit bias, projects are included in the core comparative tabulation (Annex A) only if they meet all three criteria as of June 30, 2024: (i) a national or multi‑jurisdictional project with publicly available technical/policy documents, legislative proposals, or active deployments; (ii) relevance to major currency areas (G20 or top‑20 GDP jurisdictions) or demonstrable significance for cross‑border experimentation (projects involving multiple central banks or supranational prototypes such as mBridge/Dunbar/Icebreaker); and (iii) primary‑source traceability: project claims and technical details must be verifiable from central‑bank reports, project white papers, or international‑organization surveys/trackers. Smaller‑economy live deployments (e.g., Bahamas Sand Dollar, Nigeria eNaira) are included when they meet these criteria because operational deployments yield distinct implementation lessons. The report flags any substantive developments that occurred after June 30, 2024 in the main text using the January 31, 2026 update window.

9) Thesis and the five analytic questions (operationalized). The organizing thesis is twofold and explicit: (A) among the projects meeting our June 30, 2024 reproducible baseline, a majority adopt intermediated (two‑tier) architectures for retail provision; (B) regulatory approaches nonetheless diverge markedly because jurisdictions prioritize different trade‑offs—privacy vs. traceability, AML/CFT strictness vs. financial‑inclusion aims, tight domestic control vs. cross‑border interoperability. To test this thesis, the report answers five linked, operational questions grounded in Annex A and Annex B: (1) What are the concrete design differences across projects (privacy models, wallet tiers, programmability and interoperability choices)? (2) How do projects balance AML/CFT obligations and privacy, and what mitigation strategies exist? (3) How are banks positioned under different architectures and what are financial‑stability implications? (4) What progress and barriers exist for cross‑border CBDC arrangements? (5) How is existing payments law (PSD2, MiCAR, U.S. federal/state money‑transmission rules, AML/FinCEN guidance) being adapted or challenged by CBDC functions? Each analytic section cites the project‑level evidence and legal mapping tables that underpin comparative claims.

10) What follows. With scope, methods, consistent terminology and an explicit evidentiary baseline now stated, the report proceeds to the comparative analysis of major projects’ concrete design choices—privacy models, wallet tiers and programmability features—anchored to the regulatory tensions summarized here and supported by the annexed project tabulation and legal mapping. We next turn to a background section that defines core CBDC concepts, architectures and actors, and then to the comparative design analysis grounded in the reproducible project tabulation referenced above.

## Background: CBDC Concepts, Architectures and Key Actors

Below we define the core concepts, architectures and actors that underpin CBDC design choices. To support reproducibility, we first state the evidence cutoffs that govern project‑level descriptions and policy updates referenced in the report. Scope and evidence cutoff
- Project‑level descriptions, pilot statuses and cross‑jurisdictional comparisons in this Background are based on sources published through 30 June 2024; where later policy developments affect interpretation (for example, national policy changes announced through January 2026), those are flagged explicitly in the comparative analysis. This two‑tier cutoff preserves a comparable snapshot of technical and pilot activity while allowing the report to note subsequent policy shifts (e.g., the effective halt of federal CBDC development in the United States announced in January 2025). Project‑level evidence therefore uses the June 2024 snapshot for reproducibility; policy framing and legal updates through January 2026 are noted separately (sources: BIS, FSB, FATF; policy update: national announcements). (See BIS/CPMI: https://www.bis.org/cpmi, FSB: https://www.fsb.org, FATF: https://www.fatf-gafi.org)

Basic types and legal/operational distinctions
- Retail vs wholesale: “Retail CBDC” denotes a central‑bank‑issued digital means of payment for general use by households and firms; “wholesale CBDC” denotes restricted access ledgers for financial institutions supporting interbank settlement and market infrastructure (BIS: https://www.bis.org). These categories are useful analytically but implementations often blur the line (see sections on hybrid models below).
- Account‑based vs token‑based (operational and legal implications): Account‑based models record ownership through identity‑linked ledger entries; legal claims are typically identity/contract based and custody is a matter of account records maintained by an identifiable ledger operator. Token‑based models rely on possession of a cryptographic token (the bearer principle) where settlement finality is achieved by control over the token (see NY Fed discussion: https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/08/token-or-account-based-a-digital-currency-can-be-both/ and BIS commentary: https://www.bis.org). Practical implications: (a) legal liability — account models map naturally onto deposit‑like liabilities and established banking law, while token models raise questions about possession, transferability and who bears loss when private keys are compromised; (b) custody and key management — token systems require secure end‑user or custodian key custody models; (c) settlement finality — account models can provide finality through ledger entries and central‑bank bookkeeping, while token models rely on atomic transfer mechanisms or finality rules built into the ledger. Hybrid designs can combine features to allocate legal liability and custody between the central bank and intermediaries (examples below).

Architecture typologies and operational allocation
- Direct model: End users hold central‑bank accounts or tokens directly at the central bank. Operationally this maximizes central‑bank control and simplifies monetary liability but requires the central bank to provide retail‑grade onboarding, customer service, fraud management and KYC/AML functions—scalability and operational burden are significant (BIS). 
- Two‑tier (intermediated) model: Customer onboarding, distribution, customer service and most payment rails are delegated to supervised intermediaries (banks, payment service providers); the central bank maintains settlement/back‑end liabilities and interbank finality. This has become the dominant practical approach in pilots and proposals because it leverages existing AML/KYC frameworks and operational capacity (CEPR; Brookings; BIS: https://cepr.org; https://www.brookings.edu; https://www.bis.org).
- Hybrid models (concrete allocation of custody, liability and dispute resolution): Hybrids layer limited direct central‑bank access (for example, small‑value wallets, emergency access or unbanked access channels) on top of an intermediated settlement backbone. Concretely, hybrids specify which actor: (a) holds private keys for tokens or custodial accounts; (b) performs KYC/AML and fraud resolution; (c) bears consumer loss liability; and (d) adjudicates disputes. Empirical examples: the Bahamas Sand Dollar and several Swedish e‑krona experiment variants have explored hybrid allocations in which retail access is delivered through intermediaries while the central bank preserves settlement finality and liquidity provision (see Central Bank of The Bahamas; Sveriges Riksbank; BIS overviews).

Technical building blocks and trade‑offs
- Ledger technology and messaging: Implementations range from centralized ledgers to DLT‑based designs. Regardless of ledger choice, ISO 20022 messaging, atomic cross‑ledger settlement primitives and secure key/custody models are recurring technical priorities (ISO: https://www.iso.org).
- Programmability: Programmability spans simple conditional payments (time‑ or event‑gated transfers) to Turing‑complete smart contracts. Regulatory and operational choices hinge on who can deploy and execute programmable logic (central bank, intermediaries, or third parties), where contract execution occurs (on‑ledger vs off‑chain), and how deterministic execution, auditability and failure modes are managed. Programmability raises questions about reserve backing and legal enforceability of automated actions.
- Privacy‑enhancing technologies (PETs): PETs under consideration include selective disclosure protocols, blind‑signature (Chaumian) e‑cash approaches, and zero‑knowledge proofs (ZKPs). It is important to treat PETs as tradeoffs, not plug‑and‑play solutions:
  - Selective disclosure (credentials): Enables users to reveal particular attributes (e.g., age, transaction limit) to satisfy AML/CFT requirements while keeping other transaction details private. It is relatively lightweight but requires robust identity/attribute provisioning and trusted verifiers. 
  - Blind signatures / Chaumian e‑cash: Offer strong unlinkability and bearer‑style privacy but raise AML/CFT, loss‑recovery and programmability challenges; scalability and offline‑use patterns require careful design and trusted intermediaries for reissuance or recovery.
  - Zero‑knowledge proofs: Deliver strong expressivity for proving statements about transactions without revealing underlying data (e.g., proving total balance below/above a threshold). ZKPs can be computationally intensive and may increase transaction latency and verification costs; they complicate auditability unless combined with controlled selective disclosure or escrow mechanisms. 
  - Regulatory compatibility: FATF standards require AML/CFT mechanisms; fully anonymous CBDC designs are generally incompatible with current AML/CFT expectations unless accompanied by robust, auditable selective disclosure or conditional access mechanisms (FATF guidance: https://www.fatf-gafi.org). The literature emphasizes that PETs must be evaluated on latency, throughput, verifier trust models, ability to support supervisory audit, and compatibility with dispute resolution and forensic requirements (academic PETs literature; Oliver Wyman: https://www.oliverwyman.com).

Principal policy, standards and operational actors
- Global coordination: BIS/CPMI, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), FATF, the G20 political forum and standard bodies such as ISO lead policy coordination and standardization (BIS: https://www.bis.org; FSB: https://www.fsb.org; FATF: https://www.fatf-gafi.org; G20: https://www.g20.org; ISO: https://www.iso.org).
- Operational actors: National central banks, supervisors and domestic payment authorities operationalize designs and implement regulation; private‑sector banks, PSPs and software vendors implement distribution, wallets, custody and front‑end services.

Pilot activity, maturity metrics and current state (through June 2024)
- Maturity taxonomy: The literature and policy work commonly distinguish conceptual design, controlled pilots/prototypes, scaled rollouts and production operations (BIS Innovation Hub; national central bank reports: https://www.bis.org). 
- Status snapshot (through June 2024): Most jurisdictions remained in research, pilot or prototype phases; China’s e‑CNY represented the closest large‑scale retail deployment experience to date, while many other projects (notably intermediated pilots) were at pilot or prototype stages. Cross‑border experiments such as mBridge, Dunbar and Icebreaker were prototype‑ or proof‑of‑concept stage as of June 2024 (BIS Innovation Hub; national publications: https://www.bis.org; https://www.federalreserve.gov). The report flags later policy shifts (e.g., the U.S. federal stance change in January 2025) when they affect legal or market interpretation.

Mapping background taxonomies to comparative metrics
- To make comparative analysis reproducible and transparent, we operationalize the background taxonomies into measurable attributes used in Section 4 (comparative design analysis). Examples:
  - Privacy model → measurable attributes: existence of anonymity features; selective disclosure capability; on‑ledger data minimization; auditor/forensic access controls.
  - Programmability → measurable attributes: supported primitives (conditional payments, multi‑party contracts), execution locus (on‑ledger vs off‑chain), and governance controls for contract deployment.
  - Cross‑border capability → measurable attributes: interledger/atomic settlement support, adherence to messaging standards (ISO 20022), and legal interoperability (settlement finality across jurisdictions).
  - Maturity → stages: conceptual, controlled pilot, multi‑jurisdiction prototype, scaled national rollout, production operations.
These operational mappings explain how theoretical categories in this Background are applied to specific country projects and pilot results in the comparative section that follows.

Concluding note
- The background above provides definitions, operational distinctions and the policy ecosystem needed to evaluate tradeoffs in privacy, programmability and cross‑border design. The next section uses the June 2024 project snapshot for cross‑project comparability and flags policy changes through January 2026 where they bear on interpretation. With these definitions, operational distinctions and the reproducible mapping to comparison metrics established, we next apply the June 2024 project snapshot (with noted policy updates through January 2026) to compare how leading CBDC efforts operationalize privacy, programmability and cross‑border ambitions into concrete design choices and measurable outcomes.

## Comparative Design Choices: Privacy Models, Programmability and Interoperability

With the background definitions and the reproducible mapping to comparison metrics in place, the following section applies a time‑bounded evidence snapshot to compare how leading CBDC efforts convert regulatory priorities into concrete design choices on privacy, programmability and cross‑border interoperability. Scope, method and evidence cutoff
- Evidence window and reproducibility: this comparative analysis uses a primary project snapshot dated June 2024 and supplements that snapshot with explicitly dated policy and pilot updates through January 2026. Statements that rely on material published after June 2024 are flagged with date citations in the text. The rationale for this two‑tiered cutoff is to preserve a reproducible baseline (June 2024 pilot reports and technical papers) while also reflecting a small set of consequential policy developments through January 2026 (notably U.S. federal policy changes and ECB timing updates). Primary sources include central‑bank whitepapers and pilot reports (PBoC, ECB, RBI, Federal Reserve) and BIS Innovation Hub project outputs (mBridge, Dunbar, Icebreaker). Where I summarise later updates (Nov 2025–Jan 2026), those are dated explicitly so readers can assess currency.
- Terminology and conventions used below: to avoid inconsistency, I use the following standardized terms throughout: e-CNY (China), digital euro (EU), e‑rupee (India), retail CBDC (end‑user retail systems) and wholesale CBDC (interbank/settlement systems). I use “two‑tier (intermediated)” to describe architectures where regulated intermediaries perform onboarding, KYC and most customer‑facing functions.
Operationalising privacy, programmability and interoperability: measurable attributes
To make comparisons transparent, each high‑level category is mapped to measurable design attributes used below:
- Privacy models: identity linkage (persistent identifier vs ephemeral tokens); transaction traceability (routine linkability vs selective/exception disclosure); tiering (wallet types and transaction limits tied to KYC strength); PET adoption (selective disclosure, blind signatures, ZKPs); data retention and lawful‑access arrangements.
- Programmability: allowed primitives (time locks, coupons, conditional disbursements, recurring payments); execution locus (on‑device, operator‑mediated, on‑ledger); Turing completeness (general smart contracts vs limited domain logic); auditability/liability (deterministic, auditable primitives and operator responsibility); offline capability and reconciliation constraints.
- Cross‑border capability: messaging and data‑model alignment (ISO 20022 adoption), governance model (shared platform operator vs bilateral connectors), selective‑disclosure harmonisation (AML/CFT exception rules), and legal compatibility (data‑flow/privacy laws across jurisdictions).
Comparative snapshot (primary June 2024 baseline, with dated updates through Jan 2026)
- China — e‑CNY (primary sources: PBoC whitepaper and technical notes through 2024): architecture and privacy
  - Two‑tier (intermediated) distribution with wallet types tied to identity‑verification strength; transaction limits and quotas used to implement tiering and inclusion goals. The design enables linkability under defined conditions for AML/CFT and law‑enforcement purposes; PBoC materials make the policy priority—operational traceability and monetary‑control—explicit (PBoC whitepaper; PBoC technical releases 2023–24).
  - Programmability and offline modes: pilots have demonstrated limited programmable primitives (merchant couponing, vouchers) and “dual‑offline” modes with strict caps and reconciliation requirements (PBoC pilot summaries). These primitives are mediated by authorized operators rather than open smart‑contract platforms.
  - Cross‑border posture: China has participated in BIS‑led multi‑CBDC experimentation; however, cross‑border designs reflect a domestic priority on traceability and legal‑control that will complicate selective‑disclosure alignment with privacy‑forward regimes.
- European Union — digital euro (primary sources: ECB pilot documentation to mid‑2024; preparatory updates through Nov 2025–Jan 2026)
  - Privacy emphasis: ECB pilots have stressed data minimisation, selective disclosure and user‑centred privacy consistent with GDPR principles, while explicitly experimenting with AML‑exception handling routes (ECB digital‑euro pilot reports; ECB technical papers 2023–24).
  - Programmability: experiments favour limited, auditable primitives (conditional/recurring payments, merchant‑facing coupons) with the execution and enforcement mediated by regulated intermediaries to preserve consumer protections and auditability.
  - Implementation timeline update (dated): the ECB continued preparatory work through 2024 and 2025; in November 2025 the ECB signalled a plan to issue a call for expressions of interest in 2026 as part of implementation planning (ECB closing/preparation materials; ECB public statement Nov 2025 — call for expressions of interest planned for 2026). These later items are noted for currency but do not alter the June 2024 pilot‑based design characterisation.
- United States — Federal Reserve research (primary sources: “Money and Payments” and subsequent Fed research to mid‑2024; policy update dated Jan 2025)
  - Research posture: Fed publications through 2024 explored intermediated account models, architectural trade‑offs and privacy‑enhancing techniques without committing to an operational design (Federal Reserve staff reports and research briefs 2019–2024).
  - Policy update (dated): federal policy halted U.S. federal CBDC development in January 2025; consequently, subsequent U.S. activity (post‑Jan 2025) is largely private‑sector and state‑level experimentation rather than a Fed‑led retail CBDC rollout. This policy shift materially reduces the likelihood of a U.S. federal retail CBDC in the near term (policy statements, Jan 2025).
- India — e‑rupee (primary sources: RBI pilot documents through 2024)
  - Intermediated model with mandatory KYC at onboarding, tiered limits and use cases prioritising government disbursements, subsidy targeting and remittance efficiency (RBI technical releases and pilot reports 2022–24).
  - Programmability and offline: pilots have tested conditional disbursements and limited offline modes; programmability is narrowly scoped and mediated by intermediaries for enforceability and auditability.
- BIS Innovation Hub cross‑border projects (mBridge, Dunbar, Icebreaker; primary outputs through 2022–24)
  - mBridge: demonstrated multi‑CBDC settlement on a shared, permissioned platform and identified messaging, liquidity management and governance questions (Project mBridge report, 2022–23).
  - Dunbar and Icebreaker: explored multi‑CBDC wholesale and retail corridor prototypes, emphasising trade‑offs between privacy‑preserving transaction routing and regulatory access needs; pilot outputs repeatedly emphasise that governance and legal harmonisation are as important as technical protocol choices (Project Dunbar, Project Icebreaker reports 2023–24).
Privacy‑preserving technologies (PETs): legal compatibility and operational constraints
- PETs seen in pilots and research include selective disclosure, blind signatures, federated identity, zero‑knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and secure enclaves (ECB, Fed research, BIS papers to 2024). These techniques map to our measurable privacy attributes as follows:
  - Selective disclosure and blind‑signature schemes reduce routine linkability and are generally more compatible with GDPR‑style data‑minimisation obligations if controllers document lawful bases and exception handling. However, AML/CFT laws require data retention and disclosure under specified conditions, creating a legal tension that must be resolved by exception rules or harmonised legal gateways (GDPR; FATF Guidance; central‑bank pilot legal notes).
  - ZKPs can achieve strong selective‑disclosure properties but introduce computational cost, latency and device‑capability constraints at retail scale; pilots flag scalability and throughput as practical limits for broad ZKP deployment (BIS/central‑bank technical notes).
  - Offline modes and blind‑signature approaches ease usability but complicate revocation, audit trails and reconciliations; design choices therefore pair PETs with escrowed metadata or supervised‑access gates so supervisors can meet AML/law‑enforcement duties while minimising routine exposure.
Programmability: tested primitives, guardrails and empirical constraints
- Empirical pattern across pilots (June 2024 baseline): central banks favour limited, deterministic primitives (time locks, coupons, conditional disbursements, recurring payments) rather than general, Turing‑complete smart contracts. Three recurring governance guardrails appear:
  1) Intermediated enforcement: full programmable capabilities are typically limited to regulated intermediaries so KYC/AML and consumer‑protection obligations remain enforceable.
  2) Auditability: programmable primitives are designed to be deterministic and auditable, with operator liability and dispute mechanisms specified in pilot governance documents.
  3) Scope limitation: pilots intentionally limit programmability to reduce legal uncertainty, liability exposure and systemic‑risk channels.
- Operational constraints: offline execution, device‑limitations and throughput/latency trade‑offs shape which primitives are practical at retail scale; pilot reports repeatedly cite reconciliation complexity and throughput ceilings as limiting factors (central‑bank technical notes, BIS reports).
Cross‑border interoperability: technical vs legal/governance barriers
- Technical lessons from BIS pilots: interoperability requires common messaging standards (ISO 20022), atomic settlement primitives or trusted settlement arrangements, and liquidity‑management mechanisms. mBridge and Dunbar provided prototypes showing technical feasibility for atomic cross‑currency settlement, but also exposed non‑technical frictions (Project mBridge, Dunbar reports).
- Governance and legal frictions as primary blockers: pilots consistently identify divergent traceability/selective‑disclosure models, national privacy laws (e.g., GDPR), data‑localisation rules and differing AML/CFT interpretations as major obstacles. In practice, production‑grade cross‑border CBDC links will require layered legal frameworks, mutually accepted exception rules for AML, and clear governance over operator admission, liability and dispute resolution.
Synthesis: how design choices reflect domestic priorities and the key tensions
- Mapping: national designs align with domestic regulatory priorities and market structures: e‑CNY privileges state traceability and operational control; the digital euro emphasises GDPR‑consistent privacy measures while testing AML exceptions; the Federal Reserve remained research‑oriented through mid‑2024 and federal policy halted a U.S. federal CBDC push in Jan 2025; India’s e‑rupee prioritises intermediary KYC, inclusion and government payment efficiency.
- Resulting tensions: three persistent trade‑offs recur across projects: (a) AML/CFT obligations versus routine privacy protections; (b) programmability versus enforceability/auditability; and (c) national legal regimes versus seamless cross‑border data‑flows. BIS cross‑border pilots have progressed the technical conversation but leave governance and legal harmonisation as the decisive next steps before production deployment.
Evidence and reproducibility notes
- Primary June 2024 documents: PBoC e‑CNY whitepaper and technical notes (People’s Bank of China); ECB digital‑euro pilot reports and technical papers (European Central Bank); RBI e‑rupee pilot specifications and releases (Reserve Bank of India); Federal Reserve staff reports and CBDC research briefs (Federal Reserve); BIS Innovation Hub project reports (mBridge, Dunbar, Icebreaker).
- Dated updates included through January 2026: U.S. federal policy change halting federal CBDC development (Jan 2025); ECB preparatory/implementation timing signals including a Nov 2025 announcement planning a 2026 call for expressions of interest (ECB public materials, Nov 2025). All post‑June 2024 materials cited in the section are dated in parentheses so readers can filter the primary snapshot from later policy shifts.
- Projection note: market projections (industry forecasts) estimate CBDC transaction volumes rising substantially by 2030 (projected > US$213 billion by 2030); such projections are noted separately from the pilot‑and‑policy evidence base.
Concluding remark on methodology
- Readers should treat the June 2024 snapshot as the reproducible baseline for cross‑project comparisons; any consequential policy or pilot changes observed through January 2026 are highlighted with dates. This approach preserves reproducibility while ensuring the section remains responsive to key policy shifts that affect design interpretation. These divergent design choices and unresolved governance questions create concrete operational and legal trade‑offs. The analysis that follows examines how AML/KYC obligations interact with privacy aims, how architecture choices reconfigure banks’ roles and stability risks, and where cross‑border experiments have clarified or stalled interoperability pathways.

## Regulatory Tensions, Architectures and Cross‑Border Interoperability

These divergent design choices and the unresolved governance questions in cross‑border pilots create concrete operational and legal trade‑offs. The revised analysis below fills gaps on how existing payment laws are being adapted, provides more project‑level evidence from major pilots, evaluates the empirical and modelling literature on mitigants to bank disintermediation, and adds a legal examination of cross‑border data‑sharing and privacy conflicts. 1) AML/KYC, privacy and existing payment regulation
- Interaction with existing regimes. National and regional payment laws are not being discarded; rather, CBDC designs are being adapted to fit them. In the EU the Digital Euro workstream is explicitly aligning functional aspects of retail access and third‑party interfaces with PSD2 obligations (e.g., account information and payment initiation modalities) while proposing a tiered privacy model that preserves limited anonymity for small retail payments but enables selective disclosure on suspicion of ML/TF (ECB pilot documentation; see ECB digital euro pages). In the United States regulators have stressed that CBDC activity would need to operate within the existing money‑transmission and anti‑money‑laundering frameworks: state money‑transmitter licensing remains relevant for private PSPs and FinCEN has issued guidance on applying AML controls to digital‑asset arrangements, which CBDC implementations will need to reconcile with federal and state regimes (FinCEN guidance; state regulator statements). Many central banks therefore plan bespoke rules or supervisory guidance to map wallet providers, PSPs and banks into existing license categories rather than creating parallel regimes.
- Operational consequences. Practically, this means PSD2‑style access, KYC/AML obligations, travel‑rule information flows and reporting duties are being written into CBDC access and onboarding requirements. Where PSD2 applies, the EU approach is to incorporate strong customer authentication and regulated third‑party access into the digital‑euro technical stack; in common‑law jurisdictions the mapping is being achieved via money‑transmitter and payments law analogues. This adaptive approach reduces legal friction but raises technical demands to deliver selective disclosure and audit trails that meet both privacy law (e.g., GDPR’s data‑minimisation and purpose‑limitation principles) and AML auditability.

2) Project‑level evidence on cross‑border pilots (mBridge, Dunbar, Icebreaker)
- Project mBridge (BIS, completed pilot 2022). The BIS‑led mBridge pilot demonstrated a multi‑CBDC platform enabling peer‑to‑peer exchange of multiple CBDCs on a single distributed ledger, with commercial banks operating as on‑ and off‑ramps in the prototype. Technical achievements reported in the 2022 pilot include a working proof‑of‑concept for conditional/atomic settlement across ledger accounts within the platform, integrated foreign‑exchange messaging and an initial governance model that included a multilateral operating agreement and participant onboarding rules (BIS mBridge pilot report 2022). Limitations noted by the project team included the prototype’s dependence on a common technical stack, unresolved legal vehicle choices for cross‑jurisdiction settlement finality, and the need for clearer liability and recourse frameworks.
- Project Dunbar (BIS, 2022). Dunbar explored a shared platform model for multi‑CBDC liquidity management and settlement between central banks and their commercial banks. The 2022 report emphasised experiments with tokenised settlement assets and shared ledger primitives for liquidity savings, and it surfaced governance design choices—how access, liquidity provisioning and reserve pooling are contracted among central banks and participating banks. The project highlighted operational gaps in intraday FX management and the contractual allocation of FX credit risk that must be agreed ex ante.
- Project Icebreaker (BIS, 2023). Icebreaker focused on cross‑border retail CBDC flows and ran experiments on interoperability between retail‑oriented CBDC rails, testing messaging translations, user onboarding flows and privacy‑preserving screening in a retail context. The 2023 findings underscored progress in message‑translation and end‑user experience but identified persistent technical and legal obstacles for AML screening across jurisdictions, especially where differing data‑access rules and supervisory expectations prevent straightforward sharing of transaction metadata.
- Cross‑pilot commonalities and outstanding blockers. Across these pilots the technical milestones achieved include multi‑CBDC ledger primitives, conditional/atomic exchange mechanisms within networks and prototype ISO 20022–aligned messaging. The common blockers are (i) reliably enforcing atomic payment‑vs‑payment (PvP) across independent ledger systems where finality regimes differ; (ii) fully harmonised messaging/metadata standards and richer semantics for AML flags; (iii) liquidity and intraday FX management rules for routable multi‑currency flows; and (iv) embedding privacy‑preserving AML checks that satisfy multiple supervisors simultaneously (BIS/CPMI cross‑border programme reports, pilot summaries 2022–23).

3) Legal and regulatory frictions: cross‑border data sharing and FATF operationalisation
- Data‑protection law conflicts. Cross‑border CBDC flows raise familiar but acute tensions between EU data‑protection law (GDPR) and third‑country law‑enforcement access. Transfers of personal data to non‑EEA authorities require an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses); unilateral third‑country demands for bulk access can conflict with GDPR principles and have been the subject of recent court scrutiny (e.g., Schrems jurisprudence). Pilots therefore need legal transfer mechanisms and narrowly tailored data‑access architectures (e.g., tokenised metadata, split‑knowledge models) to avoid unlawful transfers or post‑hoc legal exposure for intermediaries.
- FATF and multi‑jurisdiction AML. The FATF travel‑rule and related recommendations are being operationalised in pilot governance: projects design for collection and secure sharing of originator/beneficiary information, and for mechanisms to freeze suspect flows. However, FATF guidance leaves discretion about how providers meet AML outcomes; that discretion creates friction where one jurisdiction requires more intrusive data checks than another. Practical mitigants explored in pilots include interoperable AML‑information APIs, escrowed disclosure on legal request, and use of privacy‑preserving credentials that allow verification of risk attributes without full transaction disclosure (FATF guidance and BIS/CPMI outputs).

4) Do intermediated/hybrid models and mitigants work under stress? Evidence and limits
- Evidence from simulation and historical analogues. Multiple modelling studies (BIS, IMF, CEPR working papers) simulate scenarios of deposit flight to CBDC and find that well‑designed mitigants can substantially reduce, though not eliminate, runs in normal and moderately stressed circumstances. Key findings: tiered wallet limits and per‑user caps blunt the speed and scale of conversion; differentiated non‑zero remuneration on CBDC balances reduces the incentive to shift large deposits; and standing facilities or intraday liquidity access for banks limit the short‑term liquidity squeeze (BIS/IMF simulation studies). Empirical historical analogues—cases of digital payment migration and bank runs triggered by rumours—show that network effects and customer stickiness matter; wholesale runs remain a risk if confidence in banks collapses.
- Important caveats. The effectiveness of mitigants materially depends on parameterisation (cap sizes, remuneration spreads, speed of access to central bank facilities) and legal enforceability. Modelling consistently shows tail‑risk sensitivity: in severe stress where public confidence in banks is already impaired, mitigants slow but do not fully prevent large reallocations without backstops (deposit insurance, lender‑of‑last‑resort facilities, enhanced resolution frameworks). Pilots and models therefore conclude that intermediated designs plus conditional controls make feasible an operationally manageable transition, but they are not a panacea for systemic shock scenarios.

5) Privacy‑preserving technologies: legal compatibility and operational constraints
- What PETs can and cannot deliver. Techniques such as zero‑knowledge proofs (ZKPs), selective disclosure credentials (blind signatures) and secure multi‑party computation can reduce the need to expose full transaction histories to supervisors while enabling verifiable AML attributes. Pilots and research prototypes demonstrate feasible workflows where a wallet proves compliance attributes (e.g., customer is KYC‑verified, transaction under threshold) without revealing full provenance.
- Legal compatibility with data‑protection regimes. From a GDPR perspective, PETs help with data‑minimisation and purpose limitation, but they do not eliminate the need to process personal data for AML. Supervisory auditability and retention requirements still demand that some data be available to competent authorities under lawful process; PET designs must therefore incorporate controlled escape hatches (escrowed disclosure under judicial/legal authorisation) and clear data‑governance rules. Moreover, non‑repudiation, audit trails and evidence for criminal proceedings may require reconstruction capabilities that some PET designs make costly or complex.
- Operational constraints. PETs introduce computation and latency costs and raise questions about scalability and resilience. Several BIS/academic papers note that ZKPs and MPC add verification overheads and require careful engineering to meet retail‑scale throughput and low‑latency expectations. Governance choices about who operates PET proving/verification services, how keys and credentials are issued and revoked, and how proofs are logged for audit are central to deployments.

6) Practical policy takeaways for reconciling competing goals
- Design iteratively and law‑first. Jurisdictions should map CBDC functional rules to existing payment regimes (PSD2, money‑transmitter laws, FATF standards) early, so operational requirements (onboarding, reporting, cooperation mechanisms) are built into technical specifications rather than retrofitted. Where legal conflicts exist (e.g., GDPR v. third‑country access) pilots should test legal gateways (SCCs, narrow legal assistance channels) and governance agreements.
- Use pilots to lock in governance and legal frameworks. The cross‑border projects show that technical primitives can be proven; the harder work is multilateral governance: agreeing on finality, dispute resolution, FX‑credit allocation and data‑access thresholds. Early legal templates for multilateral operating agreements, participant onboarding and liability allocation should be part of further pilot phases.
- Calibrate mitigants and stress‑test them. Parameter choices matter: small wallet caps, non‑zero remuneration differentials and binding liquidity backstops substantially reduce disintermediation risk in models; but authorities must stress‑test extreme scenarios and build resolution and fiscal backstops where needed.
- Combine PETs with lawful disclosure mechanisms. Privacy technologies can materially improve privacy for regular retail use, but they must be paired with legally‑controlled disclosure channels for investigations and with technical auditability to satisfy prosecutors and supervisors.

Building on this updated, evidence‑based mapping of legal, technical and governance trade‑offs, the next section synthesises these elements into a compact comparative framework that maps privacy, programmability and interoperability priorities to concrete operational levers.

## Synthesis and Comparative Regulatory Framework

Building on the descriptive mapping of national design choices, this section synthesises those differences into a compact comparative framework and identifies the operational, legal and technical levers that can reconcile competing policy goals. Define four axes to map national CBDC approaches: (1) privacy vs traceability, (2) degree of bank intermediation, (3) programmability openness, and (4) cross‑border ambition. On privacy/traceability, China’s e‑CNY sits toward traceability (state‑centric monitoring), the EU’s digital euro emphasizes stronger retail privacy protections, and U.S. work remains exploratory and normative (Source: ORF analysis of e‑CNY; ECB digital euro materials; Federal Reserve research) (https://www.orfonline.org, https://www.ecb.europa.eu, https://www.federalreserve.gov). On bank intermediation most major projects converge on intermediated/two‑tier models to preserve commercial banks’ role and monetary policy transmission (Source: BIS/CPMI surveys) (https://www.bis.org). Programmability ranges from guarded experimentation (smart‑payment primitives in EU/industry pilots) to limited state‑defined rule sets (some domestic pilots) (Source: Oliver Wyman industry mappings) (https://www.oliverwyman.com). Cross‑border ambition is active in multilateral pilots (mBridge, Dunbar, Icebreaker) but remains prototype‑level; work focuses on shared messaging (ISO 20022), atomic settlement and privacy‑preserving AML checks (Source: BIS/CPMI cross‑border programme) (https://www.bis.org).  Practical mitigants for financial‑stability risk observed across literature include: tiered holding limits and account tiers, differential remuneration to discourage flight to CBDC, standing repo/facility backstops, strengthened resolution regimes and preserved deposit intermediation via two‑tier issuance (Source: CEPR, FRB modeling) (https://cepr.org, https://www.federalreserve.gov).  To reconcile AML/CFT with privacy, jurisdictions are piloting combinations of policy and technology: legal guardrails for supervisory access, tiered anonymity thresholds, selective disclosure constructs and PETs (zero‑knowledge proofs, blind credentials) to enable verifiable AML checks without wholesale transaction disclosure (Source: FATF guidance; technical PETs literature) (https://www.fatf-gafi.org, https://arxiv.org).  Remaining barriers are empirical: lack of large‑scale evidence on PETs’ efficacy for AML, unresolved legal frameworks for cross‑border data flows and jurisdictional enforcement, and standards gaps for atomic cross‑ledger settlement and FX risk allocation. Convergence on intermediated architectures lowers one class of stability risk, but harmonised technical standards and targeted legal instruments remain necessary for scalable, privacy‑respecting and interoperable CBDC deployments (Source: FSB/CPMI recommendations) (https://www.fsb.org, https://www.bis.org). The following section sets out specific policy recommendations and standardisation priorities that follow from this comparative framework.

## Conclusion: Policy Recommendations and Research Agenda

Building on the comparative framework above, the following recommendations translate those trade‑offs into a prioritized policy and research agenda for national authorities and multilateral bodies. Policy recommendations. 1) Harmonize cross‑border data‑flow and legal protocols: national authorities should adopt the FSB’s data‑flow principles as a baseline, and collaborate on model clauses and supervisory memoranda of understanding to reduce legal frictions in multi‑jurisdictional CBDC payment data exchange (Source: https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/fsb-publishes-final-recommendations-on-data-flows-to-support-cross-border-payments/). 2) Prioritize message/format standards (ISO 20022) and API interoperability: central banks should align CBDC message profilers and operational APIs with ISO 20022 to enable composable, atomic settlement rails and lower integration costs (Source: https://www.bis.org/publ/othp42.htm). 3) Pilot privacy‑preserving AML/CFT tools: fund large‑scale, controlled pilots of PETs (zero‑knowledge proofs, selective disclosure credentials) that test AML efficacy against operational performance and false‑positive burdens before regulatory endorsement (Source: https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2021/nov/cbdc-design-and-implementation.html). 4) Specify bank‑intermediation safeguards: require intermediated architectures to include tiering, per‑user limits, differentiated remuneration, standing facilities and explicit resolution/operational backstops to preserve deposit intermediation and monetary transmission. 5) Create multilateral “interoperability sandboxes”: enable cross‑border experiments with common technical stacks, FX settlement rules and supervised legal templates to accelerate learnings (Source: BIS/CPMI cross‑border work). 

Research and pilot agenda. Priorities: (a) empirical PET trials measuring AML effectiveness, operational cost and privacy leakage; (b) macro‑financial stress tests of CBDC flows under intermediary run scenarios; (c) legal pilots that exercise dispute resolution, data jurisdiction and FX allocation clauses; (d) UX and inclusion pilots to assess uptake and tiering effectiveness. Fund consortiums that pair central banks, supervisors, standards bodies and independent evaluators to ensure reproducible results (Source: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds.htm). 

Near‑term milestones to 2027. By end‑2025: agree core data‑flow baseline and ISO 20022 profilers; 2026: complete interoperable prototype tests (atomic settlement, privacy‑preserving AML checks); 2027: adopt multilateral legal/operational templates and publish consolidated PET trial outcomes to inform domestic rule‑making (Source: BIS/CPMI cross‑border programme timelines). Bottom line: intermediated CBDCs are operationally credible and convergence on standards is underway, but PET efficacy, legal enforceability across borders and systemic governance remain the primary obstacles to broad deployment. The next section reviews concrete technical standards and message profilers recommended for immediate adoption by central banks and payment infrastructures.
