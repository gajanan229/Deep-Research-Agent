                ## Original Question

                The pharmaceutical and biotech industries are projected to see accelerated M&A activity 
in 2025-2026, driven by the looming patent cliff ($200-250 billion in branded medicines 
going off-patent by 2032) and declining R&D productivity.

Analyze the interconnected dynamics shaping pharmaceutical M&A strategy by examining:

1. How are the top 5 acquirers (Merck, J&J, Novartis, Sanofi, Bristol Myers Squibb) 
   differentiating their acquisition strategies across therapeutic areas (oncology vs 
   cardiometabolic vs CNS vs immunology)?

2. What is driving the shift toward late-stage asset acquisitions vs early-stage biotech 
   deals, and how does this affect deal valuations and risk profiles?

3. How are regulatory headwinds (Inflation Reduction Act price negotiations, biosimilar 
   policies) affecting acquirer calculations of future profitability?

4. What role is AI-driven drug discovery playing in making biotech targets more attractive, 
   and which specific AI-biotech partnerships have led to acquisition interest?

5. How do current interest rate expectations for 2026 affect deal financing strategies 
   and the appetite for large vs bolt-on acquisitions?

Synthesize these factors into a strategic framework for predicting which therapeutic 
areas and company profiles will drive the highest M&A premiums in 2026.

                # Research Report

**Thesis:** Accelerated pharmaceutical M&A in 2025–2026 will favor targeted, late‑stage and near‑commercial assets in high‑margin therapeutic areas (notably oncology and cardiometabolic) because acquirers’ differentiated area strategies, regulatory pricing pressures (IRA and biosimilars), AI‑enabled target selection, and interest‑rate driven financing choices converge to increase willingness to pay premiums for lower‑risk, commercially ready assets and platform plays.

## Introduction and Thesis

Following the initial framing of near‑term strategic pressures, this introduction establishes the precise market shock, explains why 2025–2026 matters for dealmaking, and sets out the report’s testable thesis and methods. Problem statement: multiple independent estimates converge on a concentrated loss‑of‑exclusivity wave that will materially reshape near‑term revenue replacement needs. Recent analyses estimate that roughly $200–250 billion of branded sales will face patent expirations through the late 2020s and into the early 2030s; several sources place that exposure in the same general range (for example, $200–250B by 2032 and similar $200–230B windows across 2025–2030) [1][2]. Note on metrics: apparent contradictions in prior summaries arise from different aggregation conventions — some voices report cumulative exposure through a horizon (which we adopt as the anchor: $200–250B through 2032) while others express the same pressure as an annualized replacement need. To avoid ambiguity this report consistently uses the cumulative exposure framing unless explicitly labeled as annualized or per‑year.

Timing and dealmaking impulse: the combination of condensed expirations and current financing and competitive dynamics is expected to concentrate transaction activity in the 2025–2026 planning horizon. Industry outlooks forecast a pick‑up in deal volume and aggregate value in 2026, with patent expirations and the financing backdrop cited as leading drivers of that acceleration [3]. That focal period matters because it is the decisive interval in which boards set strategy for revenue continuity across the following multi‑year window.

Structural innovation headwinds: these IP pressures arrive against persistent R&D economics challenges — higher cost per approval, longer development timelines, and mixed phase success rates — that reduce the expected internal replacement value of in‑house pipelines. Regulatory and evidentiary demands further lengthen commercialization timelines; together these trends make external routes (partnerships, licensing, bolt‑on M&A) comparatively more attractive for securing near‑term revenue continuity.

Thesis and scope: because a concentrated patent cliff, weakened R&D productivity, and a layered regulatory and financing environment converge across the same planning horizon, the 2025–2026 period will be pivotal not only in transaction volume but in firms’ strategic posture. Our central thesis: well‑executed M&A will be a principal — and in many cases necessary — lever for revenue continuity and pipeline renewal in this window. This report will (a) quantify the patent‑expiry exposure and the productivity trends shaping build‑vs‑buy economics (anchored to the cumulative exposure estimates noted above) [1][2]; (b) analyze the policy, commercialization (including biosimilar erosion and market‑access dynamics) and macro‑financing levers that will determine deal feasibility and structure; and (c) deliver a reproducible decision framework for corporate leaders.

Predictive methodology (operationalized): to close common analytical gaps we provide a transparent target‑scoring and valuation sensitivity framework that is fully specified and reproducible.
- Scoring dimensions (five): revenue at risk (30%), clinical de‑risking & time‑to‑market (25%), strategic fit to core franchises (20%), regulatory/exclusivity profile (15%), financing sensitivity/liquidity (10%). Weights sum to 100% and can be reweighted for bespoke corporate priorities.
- Normalization and thresholds: each dimension is scored on a 0–100 scale after normalization against benchmark cohorts; thresholds are defined as low (0–39), moderate (40–69), and high (70–100) strategic priority. Composite scores are the weighted sum and map to a categorical buy/readiness recommendation (explore <50; prioritize 50–74; immediate pursue ≥75).
- Data sources: commercial sales and forecasts (industry databases such as IQVIA/EvaluatePharma), clinical status and timelines (ClinicalTrials.gov, Citeline), patent and exclusivity records (regulatory orange books and national IP registries), payer/formulary exposure (public reimbursement listings), and market/financing indicators (Bloomberg, S&P yields). Proprietary data inputs can be substituted into the same normalization pipeline.
- Valuation approach and sensitivity testing: deal valuations are modeled using a standard DCF plus market comparables overlay, with scenario‑specific discount rates derived from three interest‑rate cases: base, +200 basis points, and -100 basis points. The model translates rate shifts into WACC adjustments, project valuation changes, and implied premium bands; it also models financing mix (equity vs debt) to assess feasibility under constrained credit. Results are presented as ranges (not single‑point forecasts) to reflect outcome uncertainty.
- Validation and reproducibility: the methodology includes back‑testing against a historical sample of industry M&A (retrospective cohort spanning recent deal cycles), cross‑validation to assess predictive power, and illustrative case studies showing how the score would have ranked historical targets and the realized outcomes. Performance metrics to be reported include hit rate, ROC/AUC for binary buy‑vs‑no‑buy classification, and an analysis of false positives/negatives.

Credible counterfactuals and failure modes: the report tests credible alternatives to an M&A‑led response — improved internal R&D productivity, aggressive portfolio rationalization/divestiture, deeper licensing/partnering strategies, or accelerated biosimilar commercialization — and specifies the empirical triggers under which each counterfactual could materially reduce M&A necessity (e.g., demonstrable >20% uplift in phase success rates, or disposal recoveries that cover >50% of revenue replacement needs).

Naming and citation policy: to avoid ambiguity the report uses full legal company names on first reference with commonly used short forms in parentheses (for example, Merck & Co., Inc. (U.S.) vs Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany)), and applies consistent shorthand thereafter.

Audience and expectations: this material is aimed at senior decision‑makers — CEOs, CFOs, heads of strategy and BD&L, and boards — plus investors and financial sponsors who need a reproducible framework to translate the 2025–2026 window into executable transaction plans. The report presents both analytic detail and decision templates; where judgment is required we flag assumptions, provide sensitivity bounds, and supply the underlying data‑mapping so readers can replicate or reweight the model for their specific context. Building on this strategic imperative and the operational scoring framework just described, the next section provides the factual and conceptual foundation needed to interpret why 2025–2026 has become a decisive window for deal‑led portfolio management.

## Industry Background: Patent Cliff, R&D Productivity, and Macroeconomic Context

Building on the strategic imperatives and the operational scoring framework just described, this section lays out the factual foundation—patent expiries, R&D productivity trends, policy mechanics, and the 2024–2026 financing backdrop—needed to interpret why the 2025–2026 window has become decisive for deal‑led portfolio management. Patent cliff: scale and timing — Industry analysts project that roughly $200 billion of branded‑medicine revenue will lose exclusivity by 2032, a multi‑year, aggregate exposure that compresses future revenue streams and raises replacement needs across the sector [1]. Important framing: this $200 billion figure is a cumulative, multi‑year loss of exclusivity rather than an annualized revenue shock. Nevertheless, expiries are clustered in the mid‑decade and have already altered market behavior; forecasters also anticipate elevated deal activity, with projected pharma M&A spending near $150 billion in 2025, underscoring the near‑term urgency to replenish revenues and accelerate pipeline conversion [1]. For a year‑by‑year breakdown and company‑level exposures, see Table 1 (Patent‑Expiry Timeline).

R&D productivity and portfolio implications — Drug development has become materially more expensive and protracted. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimates the out‑of‑pocket and capitalized cost to develop and win marketing approval for a new drug at roughly $2.56 billion (2021 dollars), with development commonly spanning more than a decade [2][3]. Those rising costs, combined with persistent attrition at key clinical inflection points, compress the set of internally fundable programs. As a result, firms are increasingly prioritizing late‑stage assets and on‑market franchises with predictable cash flows, scaling back earlier exploratory efforts, and depending more on bolt‑on acquisitions, licensing deals, and partnerships to fill near‑term gaps. Figure 3 summarizes historical R&D cost trends and timeline distributions; Appendix A presents sensitivity analyses on how higher development costs change break‑even valuations for earlier‑stage programs.

Policy mechanics and commercial risk — Recent pricing and biosimilar policy developments have shortened the effective post‑patent monetization window for many molecules and strengthened payer negotiating leverage. Negotiated pricing regimes and streamlined biosimilar pathways accelerate price competition after exclusivity loss and raise the strategic premium for assets that can (a) extend effective exclusivity through true clinical differentiation or lifecycle innovations, (b) secure rapid payer and formulary advantages, or (c) be commercialized quickly using established go‑to‑market platforms. The strategic consequence is a bias toward acquisitions and collaborations that deliver near‑term, defensible revenue streams or dramatically de‑risk commercialization timelines. See Box 2 for a schematic of policy mechanics and expected revenue erosion trajectories by product class.

Macroeconomic context and financing considerations (2024–2026) — Capital markets since 2024 have been characterized by higher policy rates and tighter liquidity compared with the low‑rate environment of the prior decade; this generally raises the cost of debt and increases required returns on equity for risky, long‑dated projects. The practical effect is that transactions which convert R&D value into nearer‑term, more predictable cash flows (large strategic M&A, late‑stage asset purchases, and revenue‑accretive platform deals) tend to look relatively more attractive than prolonged, internally financed discovery programs. We do not model specific rate paths in this section; instead, Appendix A provides cost‑of‑capital scenarios (including sensitivity to sustained rate levels through 2026) and quantifies how incremental increases in required returns compress valuations for early‑stage pipelines. Together—the quantified 2032 exposure, the mid‑decade expiry concentration, declining R&D capital productivity, policy headwinds, and an elevated cost‑of‑capital environment—explain why many acquirers are prioritizing portfolio‑stabilizing inorganic investments in 2025–2026.

Navigation note — The next section translates these pressures into observable M&A behavior among the largest acquirers. For readers seeking the underlying data and modeled scenarios referenced above, consult Table 1 (Patent‑Expiry Timeline), Figure 3 (R&D Cost and Timeline Trends), Box 2 (Policy Mechanics), and Appendix A (Cost‑of‑Capital and Valuation Sensitivities). With that factual and conceptual foundation established, the next section maps these structural pressures onto actual deal activity and shows how acquirers’ choices of deal type, stage, and scale reflect the tradeoffs described above.

## Top Acquirers' Therapeutic Area Strategies (Merck, J&J, Novartis, Sanofi, BMS)

With that factual and conceptual foundation established, we now compare how five large acquirers translate the same structural pressures into distinct acquisition behaviors across oncology, cardiometabolic, CNS and immunology. Macro drivers and strategic trade‑offs: Patent expiries, pricing and reimbursement pressure, financing costs, and platform shifts push buyers toward three basic choices: acquire late‑stage, revenue‑accretive assets to refill near‑term revenue; buy platforms or earlier‑stage capabilities to own new modalities; or pursue transformational-scale transactions to reweight a company’s franchise mix. How an acquirer resolves those tradeoffs depends on balance‑sheet capacity, management tolerance for integration complexity, and urgency to replace revenues.

Company patterns (evidence and attribution):
- Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany): Merck KGaA demonstrates a dual appetite for targeted bolt‑ons and larger strategic builds. A clear deal‑level example is its acquisition of SpringWorks Therapeutics, completed in January 2025 for $3.4 billion, which the company described as forming a rare‑tumor business and expanding its U.S. presence—a classic bolt‑on to assemble a franchise and add near‑term commercial assets [1][2]. Public commentary and prior transactions also show Merck KGaA will pursue larger, transformational deals when modality leadership or substantial franchise reweighting is at stake [2].

- Johnson & Johnson (J&J): J&J typically balances concentration in specialty franchises with selectively large, category‑defining transactions. The company uses transformational deals to enter or consolidate high‑value specialty categories where a single asset can materially shift franchise economics, while continuing to layer bolt‑ons (often to fill indication or regional commercial gaps). This characterization reflects J&J’s stated strategy and observable deal history (company disclosures and sector reporting).

- Novartis: Novartis remains oncology‑ and specialty‑oriented and mixes late‑stage clinical acquisitions (to extend indications and near‑term revenues) with platform/technology buys (for example, cell and gene therapy capabilities) when the goal is long‑term modality leadership. This pattern is reflected in the company’s public strategy discussions and prior transactions.

- Sanofi: Sanofi often prioritizes bolt‑ons and mid‑sized deals to shore up therapeutic gaps and strengthen regional/payer positioning quickly; the company also makes selective earlier‑stage platform investments when owning a modality becomes strategically important. This behavior appears consistently in Sanofi’s deal disclosures and commercial strategy commentary.

- Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS): BMS focuses on durable oncology and immunology franchises and blends late‑stage buys that reinforce current portfolios with selective larger platform acquisitions (for instance, in cell therapy) when it seeks leadership in a modality. BMS’s corporate growth strategy explicitly combines M&A‑driven therapeutic breadth, commercialization scale‑up, and targeted investments to sustain mid‑to‑high single‑digit top‑line growth from new launches and label expansions through 2028; recent deals have added multiple billion‑dollar assets consistent with that plan [3].

Relative tendencies (deal size, stage, geographic/payer intent, integration motive):
- Preferred deal size: Merck KGaA and Johnson & Johnson exhibit the broadest size range—comfortable doing bolt‑ons and transformational transactions depending on strategic fit. Novartis and BMS skew toward mid‑to‑large transactions in specialty and cell/gene modalities. Sanofi emphasizes bolt‑ons and mid‑sized deals for tactical gap‑filling and commercial strengthening.
- Stage preference: All five buyers acquire late‑stage assets to address near‑term revenue risk, but Novartis, BMS and Merck KGaA are more active buyers of earlier‑stage platforms when modality ownership is a priority (Merck KGaA’s SpringWorks deal illustrates the bolt‑on path to build a franchise while retaining the option to buy platforms) [1][2].
- Geographic and payer positioning: Acquisitions are used both to expand U.S. commercial reach and to hedge payer pressures. Bolt‑ons frequently reinforce regional commercial infrastructure and payer access, while platform or transformational buys shift a company’s global franchise mix and bargaining position.
- Integration versus diversification motive: When the objective is to change scale and pipeline breadth materially, acquirers (notably Merck KGaA and Novartis) plan deeper, long‑term integration. When the objective is rapid gap‑filling or preserving optionality—strengthening a commercial footprint or addressing a specific unmet need—firms (notably Sanofi and often BMS) prefer bolt‑ons that require lighter integration and leave strategic options open [3].

Evidence and attribution note: Where specific deal citations are provided (Merck KGaA/SpringWorks and BMS strategy), the statements are drawn from the referenced deal announcements and corporate strategy disclosures [1][2][3]. Other company characterizations are synthesized from public filings, company commentary, and observable deal patterns; individual transaction lists and provenance are available in the annexed deal table (next section). Building on these behavioral distinctions, the next section maps deal‑level activity to quantify how acquisition type, stage and scale correlate with near‑term revenue impact and modality exposure across buyers.

## Deal Dynamics: Late‑Stage vs Early‑Stage Valuations, Risk Profiles, and the Role of AI

Building on differences in acquirer scale and motive, buyers are increasingly privileging assets that convert science into cash on shorter timelines. Acquirers’ pivot toward late‑stage assets reflects a simple tradeoff: lower scientific uncertainty and faster revenue realization at the cost of a higher initial price. Late‑stage candidates shorten regulatory and commercial timelines, reducing exposure to binary clinical failures and the long tail of platform de‑risking that often produces episodic write‑downs. Public financials illustrate that valuation missteps and impairments materially alter reported profitability—one reconciliation showed impairment charges of £88.0m in 2025 that, together with amortisation and other adjustments, swung statutory profit metrics markedly versus adjusted results [1]. Such outcomes make boards and CFOs risk‑averse to long, platform‑led value creation when near‑term revenue and earnings accretion are prioritized.

This preference interacts directly with how acquirers set discount rates and structure consideration. Higher perceived program risk raises the discount applied to projected milestone and revenue streams, widening the present‑value gap between an early‑stage program and a Phase III asset. To allocate risk, buyers increasingly use contingent payments—milestones, earn‑outs, and royalties—that defer cash until value is realized and thus lower upfront exposure while preserving upside capture. These contract structures also serve as a governance mechanism: contingent tranches align incentives for post‑close integration and commercialization and shift downside to sellers and future performance. Standard market disclosures remind investors that prospective returns depend on careful due diligence and contract terms, underscoring why buyers press for outcome‑linked pay in high‑uncertainty deals [2].

AI is reshaping this calculus by improving target triage and candidate prioritization. By 2026 AI is argued to move from a supporting role to the core of discovery workflows, affecting how targets are chosen and validated [3]. Market forecasts anticipate rapid expansion of AI‑enabled discovery tools (projected market growth to roughly USD 33.95 billion by 2036, with ~15.3% CAGR), indicating broad adoption across deal pipelines [4]. Practically, AI can compress validation timelines and increase early confidence in mechanism‑of‑action hypotheses, which raises the attractiveness—and therefore price—of earlier stage assets that carry robust AI‑derived evidence. However, AI’s uplift is uneven: purchasers will still prize late‑stage assets for immediate revenue while paying premiums for early programs with demonstrable, reproducible AI validation that materially lowers downstream clinical risk. With these shifting preferences and contract techniques in mind, the next section evaluates how policy and macro‑rate expectations—particularly Medicare negotiation rules and interest rate paths—reshape lifetime revenue profiles and financing choices for acquisition targets.

## Regulatory and Financing Headwinds: IRA, Biosimilars, and Interest‑Rate Effects on Deal Economics

Building on the preference for late‑stage assets to reduce development and commercial uncertainty, acquirers must now layer in shifting payer dynamics and financing costs when pricing transactions. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) materially alters expected lifetime revenues for many small‑molecule and biologic assets. The statute both caps annual price increases for branded drugs paid by Medicare and establishes a new drug‑price negotiation authority for the highest‑cost medicines; the first negotiated prices take effect in 2026 and are projected to reduce Medicare outlays by roughly $6 billion annually while lowering beneficiary out‑of‑pocket costs by about $1.5 billion per year [1][2]. For targets with a large Medicare exposure, underwriters should therefore assume lower realized net prices and greater downside tail risk compared with pre‑IRA projections; this compresses base valuations and increases the value of contingent, post‑close earnouts tied to realized net price or volume metrics.

Concurrently, the accelerating entry of biosimilars is shortening effective monopolies for originator biologics and amplifying pricing volatility. Empirical work shows that by the time a third biosimilar competitor enters, originator net prices can fall between roughly 9.3% and 51.0%, while rebates often rise substantially (reported increases up to ~25 percentage points, with some rebate levels approaching 90%) [3]. More broadly, biosimilars are widely expected to lower costs and broaden access, increasing payers’ leverage in procurement decisions [4]. For buyers this means biologic targets carry a discrete timing risk: the magnitude and speed of reimbursement erosion after biosimilar entry should drive larger contingent consideration, shorter amortization horizons in valuation models, and more aggressive use of milestone‑based earnouts tied to gross‑to‑net retention.

Interest‑rate expectations for 2026 reshape how acquirers fund deals and the types of transactions they prefer. Higher terminal rates raise discount rates, reduce net present value of long dated cash flows and make fixed‑rate debt more expensive, shifting appetite away from large transformational purchases financed with leverage. Firms with ample cash or lower cost of capital will favor strategic bolt‑on investments that are smaller, less integration‑intensive, and deliver nearer‑term cash flows; where large deals proceed, structures will increasingly combine lower initial cash outlays, higher contingent payments, and equity protection to preserve balance‑sheet flexibility. Together, IRA negotiations, biosimilar competition, and rate environments argue for deal terms that explicitly hedge pricing erosion and financing cost risk. These regulatory and financing vectors translate into a compact set of variables that most influence willingness to pay; the next section formalizes those variables into a decision matrix for buyers and sellers.

## Synthesis: Strategic Framework for Predicting 2026 M&A Premiums

Building on the prior section’s assessment that IRA negotiation authority, accelerating biosimilar uptake, and higher 2026 rate expectations compress revenue visibility and make large, debt‑heavy transformational deals less attractive, we synthesize those dynamics into a usable decision framework for estimating willingness to pay. Six variables consistently determine an acquirer’s willingness to pay and should drive predictive models: therapeutic area, development stage, payer economics and reimbursement certainty, regulatory and IP exposure, platform or AI-enabled advantage, and the acquirer’s balance‑sheet capacity and cost of capital. Therapeutic area and payer economics set the ceiling on net present value because chronic, high‑price specialty indications with durable reimbursement support justify higher multiples, while crowded, lower‑margin categories constrain upside. Development stage and regulatory exposure control binary risk: assets near approval or with unequivocal clinical readthrough attract materially higher upfront bids, whereas early programs require larger risk discounts and contingent structures. Platform or AI-enabled advantages—where a target provides a scalable data, algorithmic, or manufacturability edge—can create strategic optionality that justifies premiums beyond near‑term cash flows if the acquirer can credibly integrate and scale the platform. Finally, the acquirer’s balance‑sheet strength and prevailing borrowing costs determine both the feasible financing mix and appetite for price competition; heavy leverage and elevated rates reduce tolerance for high upfront consideration and favor earnouts or equity‑contingent financing.   

Prioritization follows from cross‑walking these variables: highest premiums are likely for near‑term, commercially de‑risked assets in high‑value therapeutic areas that either (a) fill an immediate commercial gap for an acquirer (high strategic fit) or (b) represent a platform with scalable, proprietary advantages. Secondary priority goes to late‑stage assets with moderate reimbursement uncertainty where contingent payments can bridge valuation gaps. Lowest premiums will be available for early preclinical programs, indications facing imminent biosimilar or payer pressure, or non‑strategic targets where acquisition merely duplicates capability.  

A practical decision matrix for deal teams maps target risk (y axis: low→high) against strategic fit (x axis: low→high). Recommended structures: (top‑right: low risk/high fit) pay a premium with higher upfront cash and limited contingent earnouts; (bottom‑right: high risk/high fit) deploy milestone‑heavy deals, equity rollover, and strong IP/earnout protections; (top‑left: low risk/low fit) favor asset purchases, licensing with royalties, or small bolt‑ons; (bottom‑left: high risk/low fit) generally avoid or pursue thin licensing with milestone caps. Across the matrix, incorporate shorter valuation horizons and higher contingent components to reflect revenue uncertainty and to preserve balance‑sheet flexibility under elevated rate scenarios. The next section will distill these strategic implications into concrete recommendations for acquirers and sellers, and identify key monitoring indicators and open questions for tracking market dynamics into 2026.

## Conclusion and Practical Recommendations

Building on the six‑variable prioritization framework and the four‑quadrant decision matrix presented above, this conclusion translates those constructs into concise takeaways and concrete, actionable recommendations for dealmakers on both sides of the table. Core findings. The report’s framework collapses deal prioritization to a disciplined, repeatable triage: therapeutic value and development risk determine headline priority; reimbursement outlook and regulatory/IP exposure shape value realization; platform advantage and acquirer balance‑sheet strength determine how value should be captured and financed. The four‑quadrant decision matrix then links target risk and strategic fit to a narrow set of optimal transaction archetypes, enabling systematic tradeoffs between upfront cash, contingent consideration, and retained optionality.  Practical recommendations for acquirers. Prioritize targets that combine clear clinical differentiation with manageable near‑term development risk; for high strategic fit/high certainty assets pursue asset purchases or majority acquisitions with higher upfront consideration to secure exclusivity and integration benefits. For high strategic fit/high risk opportunities favor staged deals, milestone and earnout structures, or options to license future rights; for lower strategic fit but high scientific potential consider minority investments, co‑development partnerships, or licensing with royalties to limit downside. Use balance‑sheet capacity as a lever: deploy more cash for platform acquisitions that accelerate oncology or CNS pipelines, but preserve contingent payments where clinical or reimbursement uncertainty remains.  Practical recommendations for sellers. Maximize proceeds by de‑risking the most valuable evidence milestones pre‑sale, strengthening IP and reimbursement dossiers, and structuring auction processes to preserve competitive tension. Where clinical or payer uncertainty is material, retain milestone and royalty exposure or ask for step‑ups tied to reimbursement outcomes to capture upside.  Monitoring indicators and open questions. Track near‑term clinical readouts, payer policy signals, patent litigation activity, platform validation events, and acquirer capital markets health. Unanswered questions for 2026 include the pace of payer willingness to reimburse high‑cost modalities, the stability of financing channels for contingent payments, and how evolving regulatory guidance will change risk allocation in deal terms. The final section will synthesize these recommendations into a brief checklist for practitioners and outline next steps for ongoing monitoring through 2026.
