    title: "Pharmaceutical M&A Strategic Analysis"
    question: |
      The pharmaceutical and biotech industries are projected to see accelerated M&A activity 
      in 2025-2026, driven by the looming patent cliff ($200-250 billion in branded medicines 
      going off-patent by 2032) and declining R&D productivity.
      
      Analyze the interconnected dynamics shaping pharmaceutical M&A strategy by examining:
      
      1. How are the top 5 acquirers (Merck, J&J, Novartis, Sanofi, Bristol Myers Squibb) 
         differentiating their acquisition strategies across therapeutic areas (oncology vs 
         cardiometabolic vs CNS vs immunology)?
      
      2. What is driving the shift toward late-stage asset acquisitions vs early-stage biotech 
         deals, and how does this affect deal valuations and risk profiles?
      
      3. How are regulatory headwinds (Inflation Reduction Act price negotiations, biosimilar 
         policies) affecting acquirer calculations of future profitability?
      
      4. What role is AI-driven drug discovery playing in making biotech targets more attractive, 
         and which specific AI-biotech partnerships have led to acquisition interest?
      
      5. How do current interest rate expectations for 2026 affect deal financing strategies 
         and the appetite for large vs bolt-on acquisitions?
      
      Synthesize these factors into a strategic framework for predicting which therapeutic 
      areas and company profiles will drive the highest M&A premiums in 2026.

    title: "Renewable Energy Technology Convergence"
    question: |
      The utility-scale renewable energy landscape in 2025 is experiencing rapid technological 
      convergence, with solar, wind, and battery storage increasingly deployed as integrated 
      systems rather than standalone technologies.
      
      Conduct a technical and economic analysis of this convergence by examining:
      
      1. How have lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cost declines (current installed costs 
         $180-300/kWh for utility-scale) changed the economic calculus for solar-plus-storage 
         vs standalone solar deployments across different grid regions?
      
      2. What are the technical tradeoffs between 4-hour, 8-hour, and longer-duration storage 
         configurations for different use cases (peak shaving, renewable firming, grid 
         arbitrage, seasonal storage)?
      
      3. How do capacity factors for onshore wind (30-50%), offshore wind (up to 60%), and 
         solar (15-25%) affect optimal hybrid configurations in different geographic contexts?
      
      4. What role are AI-powered battery management systems and predictive analytics playing 
         in optimizing storage dispatch and extending battery lifecycle?
      
      5. How are agrivoltaics and floating solar affecting land-use calculations and project 
         economics for utility-scale deployments?
      
      Synthesize these technical and economic factors into recommendations for optimal 
      renewable+storage configurations across different grid contexts and use cases.

    title: "Cross-Border CBDC Regulatory Landscape"
    question: |
      Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are advancing rapidly with over 130 countries 
      exploring or piloting implementations, yet regulatory frameworks remain fragmented 
      across jurisdictions.
      
      Analyze the emerging regulatory and operational landscape for CBDCs by examining:
      
      1. How do the design choices of major CBDC projects (China's e-CNY, EU's digital euro 
         pilot, US research programs, India's e-rupee) differ in terms of privacy models, 
         programmability, and cross-border interoperability?
      
      2. What are the key regulatory tensions between AML/KYC requirements and privacy 
         preservation in different CBDC implementations, and how are jurisdictions attempting 
         to balance these competing objectives?
      
      3. How do different CBDC architectures (direct model, two-tier system, hybrid approaches) 
         affect the role of commercial banks and implications for financial stability?
      
      4. What progress has been made on cross-border CBDC interoperability projects (mBridge, 
         Dunbar, Icebreaker) and what technical and regulatory barriers remain?
      
      5. How are existing payment regulations (PSD2 in EU, money transmission laws in US) 
         being adapted or challenged to accommodate CBDC operations?
      
      Synthesize these regulatory developments into a comparative framework showing how 
      different jurisdictions are approaching CBDC deployment tradeoffs.

    title: "Enterprise AI Document Processing Solutions"
    question: |
      Mid-sized healthcare organizations (500-2000 employees) processing high volumes of 
      clinical documentation, insurance claims, and regulatory filings face critical decisions 
      about AI-powered document processing solutions.
      
      Compare and analyze the leading solutions for this use case by examining:
      
      1. How do the major players (Microsoft Azure AI Document Intelligence, Google Document 
         AI, AWS Textract + Comprehend Medical, Kofax, ABBYY, Rossum) compare in terms of 
         healthcare-specific extraction accuracy for clinical notes, lab reports, and 
         insurance claims?
      
      2. What are the HIPAA compliance and BAA (Business Associate Agreement) offerings of 
         each solution, and how do their data residency and processing location options 
         affect compliance postures?
      
      3. How do pricing models (per-page, per-document, per-character, subscription tiers) 
         affect total cost of ownership at different processing volumes (10K, 100K, 1M 
         documents/month)?
      
      4. What integration capabilities exist with major healthcare EHR/EMR systems (Epic, 
         Cerner, MEDITECH) and revenue cycle management platforms?
      
      5. How do these solutions handle mixed document types (structured forms, unstructured 
         clinical narratives, handwritten annotations, scanned images) and what accuracy 
         tradeoffs exist?
      
      Synthesize this comparison into specific recommendations for different organizational 
      profiles (single-site clinic vs multi-facility system vs payer organization).

    title: "Climate-Food Security Investment Analysis"
    question: |
      Global food security faces paradoxical conditions in 2025-2026: aggregate commodity 
      supplies appear stable while acute food insecurity affects 318+ million people, with 
      climate impacts increasingly disrupting agricultural supply chains.
      
      Analyze the investment and risk landscape at the intersection of climate and food 
      security by examining:
      
      1. How have recent climate events (droughts in cocoa-producing regions, flooding in 
         grain belts, shipping disruptions from Red Sea tensions, Panama Canal water levels) 
         affected agricultural commodity prices, trading patterns, and supply chain resilience?
      
      2. What climate-resilient agriculture technologies (drought-resistant crop varieties, 
         precision irrigation, vertical farming, AI-powered yield prediction) are attracting 
         private investment, and what is the evidence for their scalability and ROI?
      
      3. How are agricultural commodity traders and food companies adjusting their supply 
         chain strategies (diversified sourcing, strategic reserves, cold chain investments) 
         in response to climate volatility?
      
      4. What policy mechanisms (carbon pricing, agricultural subsidies, food security 
         reserves, trade restrictions) in major producing and consuming nations are shaping 
         investment flows and risk profiles?
      
      5. How do projections for climate impacts on wheat, rice, maize, and soy yields over 
         the next decade (7-12% wheat yield decline, 35% rice profitability reduction per 
         published studies) affect long-term investment theses in agriculture?
      
      Synthesize these factors into an investment framework identifying which agricultural 
      subsectors and geographies present the best risk-adjusted opportunities given climate 
      trajectories.
