    question: |
      The global pharmaceutical supply chain experienced significant stress in 2024-2025, 
      with persistent drug shortages affecting multiple countries. Analyze the interconnected 
      causes of these shortages by examining:
      
      1. The geographic concentration of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacturing 
         (quantify the shares held by China and India)
      2. How geopolitical tensions and trade policies (US-China decoupling, export restrictions) 
         affected specific drug categories
      3. The role of climate events (hurricanes, extreme weather) in disrupting production
      4. Why generic injectable drugs and antibiotics are disproportionately affected
      5. What structural economic factors discourage pharmaceutical companies from investing 
         in robust supply chains for essential medicines
      
      Provide specific examples of drugs affected and quantify the scope of shortages 
      (number of active shortages, duration, regional variations).

    question: |
      Global food commodity markets are projected to be stable in 2024/25 with adequate 
      supplies. Yet acute food insecurity is at record levels and rising. This apparent 
      contradiction reveals fundamental assumptions about food security that merit 
      critical examination.
      
      Analyze this disconnect by examining:
      
      1. The difference between global aggregate supply and regional/local access
      2. How commodity price stability can coexist with food insecurity increases
      3. The role of conflict and displacement in creating food insecurity beyond 
         production capacity
      4. Why famine conditions exist in places where food is physically available nearby
      5. The limitations of market-based approaches to food security
      6. Whether humanitarian response models are adequate for structural food 
         insecurity
      
      Critically evaluate the assumption that food security is primarily a production 
      and price problem.

    question: |
      AI companies have published frontier safety frameworks, joined international 
      commitments, and increased safety research. Yet evidence suggests some companies 
      have simultaneously weakened specific safety commitments over time.
      
      Resolve this apparent contradiction by examining:
      
      1. The proliferation of safety frameworks (quantify companies with published 
         frameworks over time)
      2. Specific examples of safety commitments being weakened or removed
      3. The "conditional commitment" problem and its implications
      4. Whether framework proliferation represents genuine safety progress or 
         strategic positioning
      5. How the competitive dynamics of AI development affect safety commitment 
         credibility
      6. What would distinguish genuine safety commitment from performative measures
      
      Assess whether the AI safety governance landscape is improving or deteriorating, 
      using specific evidence rather than stated intentions.

# NOTES FOR HUMAN VERIFICATION
# =============================================================================

verification_notes: |
  DESIGN PHILOSOPHY CHANGES FROM V1.0:
  1. All questions now require 10-20+ sources for comprehensive answers
  2. Topics diversified: no more than 2 questions per major domain
  3. Multi-step reasoning required in BOTH information gathering AND synthesis
  4. Questions designed to be unsolvable by simple LLM + single web search
  5. Adversarial questions include explicit "traps" that test for deeper analysis
  
  SILVER DATASET CONSTRUCTION:
  1. All required_facts extracted from web search results conducted January 2026
  2. Dates and figures should be verified against primary sources
  3. Some facts may become outdated - verify against current sources before finalizing
  
  KEY VERIFICATION POINTS:
  - Pharmaceutical data: FDA, WHO, BloombergNEF, industry reports
  - Water data: NASA, UCSB groundwater studies, FAO, World Bank
  - Critical minerals: IEA, USGS, EU Commission, Chinese trade announcements
  - Shipping: Xeneta, Freightos, port authority reports
  - AMR: WHO, Lancet, GRAM Project
  - Energy: NERC, EIA, utility reports
  - Biodiversity: WWF, IPBES, COP16 outcomes
  - CBDCs: BIS, ECB, central bank announcements
  - Space: ESA, FCC, SpaceX disclosures
  - Biosecurity: Carnegie Endowment, White House OSTP
  
  CONTAMINATION CHECK:
  Before using this dataset, test each question against Gemini Flash or GPT-4o-mini 
  with a single web search call. Questions that can be answered correctly with one 
  search should have their complexity increased.
  
  TEMPORAL SENSITIVITY:
  This dataset was created January 2026. Questions reference current events from 
  2024-2025. Regular updates needed for longitudinal tracking. Some adversarial 
  questions specifically test whether agents track policy changes over time.
