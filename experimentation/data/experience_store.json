      "Add \"case study\" or ROI-focused modifiers and domain names to find measurable, real-world results (e.g., search \"LLM case study finance ROI\" or \"customer service LLM cost savings\" to surface concrete metrics, architectures, and trade-offs).",
      "Use MLOps/action-oriented terms to retrieve practical integration and runtime guidance (e.g., combine \"LLM\" with \"deploy\", \"monitor\", \"scale\", \"model drift\", \"A/B testing\" to find operational playbooks, tooling, and observability patterns).",
      "Target specific failure modes plus mitigation keywords to find concrete defenses and patterns (e.g., search \"mitigating hallucinations\", \"preventing data leakage\", \"bias mitigation techniques\", or \"LLM guardrails\" to locate tests, filtering pipelines, and governance checklists)."
