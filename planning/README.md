# Planning Phase: Deep Research Agent

This folder contains the architectural planning and design work for the Deep Research Agent project.

## Overview

The planning phase bridges research and experimentation. It defines the architectural paradigms to be tested, evaluates their feasibility, and establishes a roadmap for experimental validation. All design decisions in this phase are informed by the research conducted in Phase 1.

## Contents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Research_Paradigms.md](./Research_Paradigms.md) | Defines eleven architectural paradigms for deep research agents |
| [Paradigm_Feasibility_Report.md](./Paradigm_Feasibility_Report.md) | Engineering analysis and tier-based recommendations |
| [Experimental_Roadmap.md](./Experimental_Roadmap.md) | Validation methodology and experimental notebook specifications |

## Key Outcomes

### Paradigm Design

Eleven architectural paradigms were designed to address challenges in deep research agents, including:

- Neuro-Symbolic knowledge graph integration
- Diffusion-based iterative refinement
- Active inference for information-gain-driven search
- Agile sprint-based research execution
- Industrial control quality gates

### Feasibility Analysis

Each paradigm was evaluated across six dimensions: effectiveness, implementation complexity, token cost, problem importance, infrastructure requirements, and debuggability.

**Tier Recommendations:**

| Tier | Paradigms | Recommendation |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Tier 1 | Agile, Industrial Control, Iterative Refinement, Stream Processing | Implement now |
| Tier 2 | Neuro-Symbolic, GNWT Router, Immunological, Active Inference | Consider with caution |
| Tier 3 | Latent Diffusion, Epistemic Market, Stigmergy, Self-Organizing | Avoid |

### Experimental Roadmap

The roadmap defines the validation methodology for the experimentation phase, including:

- Baseline agent specifications
- Golden dataset with 20 questions across 4 difficulty tiers
- Metrics framework for fact recall, citation precision, and token efficiency
- Success criteria for paradigm validation

## Next Steps

The outputs from this planning phase feed directly into Phase 3 (Experimentation), where each Tier 1 paradigm is implemented and validated in Jupyter notebooks.
