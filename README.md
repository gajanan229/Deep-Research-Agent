# Deep Research Agent

## Overview

The **Deep Research Agent** is a professional AI-driven system designed to conduct autonomous, multi-phase research. Leveraging **LangGraph** and **LangChain**, this agent orchestrates complex research workflows involving information gathering, planning, experimentation, and implementation.

## Project Phases

This project is organized into four distinct phases. The current status is tracked below:

- [x] **Phase 1: Research**
  - Gathering papers, articles, and domain knowledge.
  - *Location:* `/research`
- [x] **Phase 2: Planning**
  - Architectural design, paradigm analysis, and implementation roadmaps.
  - *Location:* `/planning`
- [ ] **Phase 3: Experimentation**
  - Prototyping workflows, testing paradigms, and validating designs.
  - *Location:* `/experimentation`
- [ ] **Phase 4: Implementation**
  - Production-ready code and agent deployment.
  - *Location:* `/src`

## File Structure

The project is structured to maintain a clean separation of concerns:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `research/` | Stores research papers, notes, and reference materials. |
| `planning/` | Holds paradigm designs, feasibility analysis, and implementation roadmaps. |
| `experimentation/` | Contains Jupyter notebooks and experimental scripts for validating paradigms. |
| `src/` | The core source code for the Deep Research Agent application. |

## Technologies

- **LangGraph**: For building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.
- **LangChain**: For efficient LLM chaining and tool integration.
- **Python**: Core programming language.
